Script is good, movie is better. It restored my faith in the canon. And by doing so, it made the world a better place. Ten stars, simply because it is One Of The Best Batman movies. And everybody loves Batman. Even without the nipples. Especially without the nipples.</p><hr><p><b>Jose</b> <a href="mailto:joseybrian@optonline.net" title="E-mail User"><img src="/images/emailuser.gif" border=0></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I believe that this one of the best Batman movies ever made. You want to know what made it really good? Katie Holmes!</p><hr><p><b>Alan</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Finally Batman is taken seriously.

My hope is that now that the powers at be can see that Frank Miller's comics were Batman at his best, we stand a chance of one day seeing his greatest Batman story: "The Dark Knight Returns" on the silver screen.</p><hr><p><b>DarthRay</b> <a href="mailto:darthray90@comcast.net" title="E-mail User"><img src="/images/emailuser.gif" border=0></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=/images/rating/5-stars.gif> (5 out of 10 )<br>The one big weakness of this script is a lack of strong villains. Ra's Al Ghul is good but he doesn't appear enough. Also his surprise reappearance is not very shocking. The Scarecrow is given a big injustice. He shows no fighting skills and is easily beaten two times, once by getting hit with a taser-equipped Katie Holmes (although it was kind of funny). Also, this film tries too hard to be profound and psychological. As a result we get a typical martial arts movie.</p><hr><p><b>Marcin</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>Best comic book movie of all time.</p><hr><p><b>Dallas</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I've seen this movie and played the game as well.</p><hr><p><b>Kaorii</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>I was really looking forward to it, then I saw it and I LOVE Christian Bale! He has THE best Batman voice ever. But 3 things: Katie Holmes is really annoying, Scarecrow isn't scary and Katie Holmes shoots Scarecrow with a tazar gun and then he dies which I found very wimpish of him. But overall, the Batman in this movie was GREAT! I can't wait for the next movie!</p><hr><p><b>Maggie</b> <a href="mailto:lazylumberjack23@yahoo.com" title="E-mail User"><img src="/images/emailuser.gif" border=0></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie is no doubt the best Marvel movie! It was amazing and I love Cillian Murphy. He plays the best bad guy! Christian Bale was also awesome.</p><hr><p><b>Carey L. Hall</b> <a href="mailto:hallway007@sbcglobal.net" title="E-mail User"><img src="/images/emailuser.gif" border=0></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>I believe the next one will be better. The story has been told. Now on to some serious crime fighting.</p><hr><p><b>botany</b> <a href="mailto:wicked_is_awesome@yahoo.com" title="E-mail User"><img src="/images/emailuser.gif" border=0></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Best movie ever, even though the ending was cheap.</p><hr><p><b>I'm not telling you!</b> <a href="mailto:superspaz@rogers.com" title="E-mail User"><img src="/images/emailuser.gif" border=0></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I think the movie had one flaw: The Wayne's murderer is supposed to become the Joker. That's how the comics went, that's how this should be.</p><hr><p><b>Kate</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Christian Bale was perfect for the role and the movie was one of the best I've seen. I was genuinely suprised; I definitely wasn't expecting such a fantastic action movie due to all the crap they shoot at us nowadays. One of the things that makes Batman Begins so good is because the director minimalizes the use of CGI and implements more stage effects instead of green screen. Everybody should go see this movie. The only thing I didn't like was Katie Holmes, but the pure AWESOMENESS of this movie makes up for her lackluster performance.</p><hr><p><b>Cyberpunk2077</b> <a href="mailto:steinberg77@yahoo.com" title="E-mail User"><img src="/images/emailuser.gif" border=0></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>Batman Begins can be easily summed up in three words. See it now! This film was an absolute pleasure to watch. There was a surplus of talent behind and in front of the screen. Christopher Nolan directed this film with such respect for the character and comic it is based on, that it brought a tear of joy to my eye. Finally a director that gets it right, Chris treated this film as a serious piece of work and not some kind of comedic satire as did Joel Schumacher. The story was brilliantly written by David S Goyer who also co-wrote the screenplay with Nolan, thus redeeming himself after Blade Trinity in my book. Christian Bale's performance was nothing short of phenomenal. Although I must admit I have been a long time fan of Bale and when I first heard that he would be taking the role of the Dark Knight under the direction of Nolan, I knew we had a winner here. Bale not only exceeded in making this character believable, he looked good doing it too. Cillian Murphy known for his performance in 28 Days Later played Dr. Jonathan Crane AKA Scarecrow. All I can say is The Academy of Arts and Sciences really need to create a new category called "Achievement in Casting", nominate and announce the winners John Papsidera & Lucinda Syson (the casting directors of BB) in the next Oscars. Trust me they deserve it. This film possibly has the best casting choices of any film I have ever seen in my life. (Take some notes Bryan Singer & Mark Steven Johnson!) That being said Cillian Murphy floored me with his portrayal of Dr. Crane in the film. Michael Caine's portrayal of Alfred was inspiring and emotionally accurate. The role of Sergeant Gordon was played by one of the best character actors alive today, Gary Oldman. The funny thing about this casting choice was even though he did a wonderful job as always, I'm so used to Oldman playing such outlandish and villainous roles that I kept expecting Gordon to do something oddly out of character. Needless to say it didn't happen. Morgan Freeman, Liam Neeson, Tom Wilkinson, Rutger Hauer, and Ken Watanabe were all incredible as I expected. Katie Holmes was a pleasure to watch in her portrayal of Rachel Dawes, the assistant district attorney. You'd be hard pressed to find one bad acting job in this movie. I have one and only one problem with this film. And that would be the cinematography during the fight scenes. It's the usual "cameraman in an earthquake" editing much like in the movie Daredevil. This is a pet peeve of mine that I can't overlook. Perfect examples of how cinematography should be done during fight sequences are in such films as Blade 1, the Matrix Trilogy and most of the more realistic Kung Fu films from our filmmaker friends far east. Other than that Batman Begins was the kind of film most Caped Crusader fans until now could only dream about. Final Recommendation: Didn't you hear me say go see it now!</p><hr><p><b>blackman</b> <a href="mailto:deltalady78@bellsouth.net" title="E-mail User"><img src="/images/emailuser.gif" border=0></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>I love this movie but I wish the fight scenes were clearer.</p><hr><p><b>Jonathan</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie was great, but I couldn't help but read some of the post that were just INCORRECT, although I know most are just YOUR opinions and I respect that, but some went WAY off. For instance, Kaorii, Scarecrow DOESN'T die in the end, he simply rides away hurt by the tazor gun. Maggie, this is a DC Comics movie, not Marvel. I'm Not Telling You!, The comics say Joe Chill murdered Wayne's parents, Tim Burton who directed Batman 1989, put the Joker as the killer so that Batman would have a reason to hate Joker. Cyberpunk2077 and blackman, the fight scenes aren't clear because Nolan wanted the audience to see what it's like to fight the Dark Knight, quick. Also what it's like to fight someone, when someone is punching you all you see are flashes. Overall this movie is great, can't wait for its sequel.</p><hr><p><b>Chowmit</b> <a href="mailto:chowmit@hotmail.com" title="E-mail User"><img src="/images/emailuser.gif" border=0></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Incredible script! Props to David Goyer. He has such an imagination and I guess Christopher Nolan used every bit for his movie - and I can't blame him. It's amazing.</p><hr><p><b>prodigalNIKON</b> <a href="mailto:twitch32885@hotmail.com" title="E-mail User"><img src="/images/emailuser.gif" border=0></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>THANK YOU JONATHAN. No offense people, but I hate to see so many people write as though stating facts, when they are completely incorrect. Chief among these were the Marvel Comics comment (and for the record, I really like some of the marvel Comics movies so far, but that doesn't exactly apply here), the comment about Joker killing Bruce's parents, and the Scarecrow dieing. Anyway, I thought this was a VERY spectacular movie. I don't know about better than Tim Burton's original Batman, its hard to judge two such completely different styles. Tim Burton definitely went the route of the mysterious, subdued-fear Batman; EXAMPLE- when Michael Keaton is scrapping with a couple of muggers only to stop and say at barely above a whisper, "I'm Batman," it just sends chills down your spine. Unfortunately for him, they weren't able to solve the problem of wearing 50 lbs of not-particularly-flexible-rubber, something that's not the easiest to move and fight in. And that's one of the wonderful things of Batman Begins. They not only pulled a an amazing actor capable of not only portraying the dual characters of Batman/Bruce Wayne, but costume designers gave him something he could really strut his stuff in. And don't get me started on the rest of the cast-- AMAZING. I continue to fall in love with Michael Cain's roles, his portrayal of Alfred was very moving. Cillian Murphy was creepy in the most wonderful way, and will hopefully return in some sequal eventually. Morgan Freeman as Fox was more than a pleasant surprise, a small role I definitely loved to death. And it was very interesting to see Liam Neesan put his 'mentoring' role (which is almost expected of him on screen, it seems) to the Villianous side. Its not too often you see a Villian you really feel for. And as always Gard Oldman shines, easily one of my personal favorite actors of all time. All in all, you're sadly missing out if you've missed this flim.</p><hr><p><b>Ashok</b> <a href="mailto:ashok_1504@rediffmail.com" title="E-mail User"><img src="/images/emailuser.gif" border=0></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>Finally, Christopher Nolan breathes life to a character which personifies the tormented hero. The script is beautifully pieced together with more emphasis on the basics instead of ridiculously insane stunts. Not only that, we are able to believe for once that such a man can actually exist amongst ourselves. The Movie boasts an impressive star cast, traditional stunts (Mr Nolan uses minimum CG),a solid script giving birth to a host of cheesy one liners. Bale is fantastic in playing the vigilante as well the "playboy". Cillian Murphy plays his role to perfection. Caine, Oldman, Freeman and Neeson are excellent. Looking forward to see The Dark Knight.</p><hr><p><b>Joseph Kerr</b> <a href="mailto:oldtrafford1999@hotmail.co.uk" title="E-mail User"><img src="/images/emailuser.gif" border=0></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>I liked this movie because of the fantastic script by David Goyer but I feel Chris Nolan's directing style, although good, wasn't what a Batman film should be at this time. I feel Tim Burton's darker, mysterious style was far better for a Batman film and felt his two were better than this one purely on style but not on script quality. That said, anything is better than the painful 5 odd hours of Batman and Robin and Batman Forever done by Joel Schumacher. Disgrace to Batman those films were! Also I myself am a screenwriter and was talking with Michael Ulsan two weeks ago and he offered me the job of Co-Writer in the next Batman film alongside Chris Nolan who will again be directing. We have thought of a title but nothing else yet! Some of you guys wont believe me because you wont have heard of me yet! But trust me, and if you want any clues on the next Batman film, We think the villain is going to be Two-Face (Harvey Dent).</p><hr><p><b>maggie</b> <a href="mailto:maggiestar@bellsouth.net" title="E-mail User"><img src="/images/emailuser.gif" border=0></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I really enjoyed this movie so much. I am a huge batman fan and always will be. Christian Bale was great as usual and Liam Neeson wow. My favorite part was probably at the end where Gordon reveals to batman that there's another villain on the move, then batman take the card and it's the joker. That gave me chills just watching it. I saw the Dark Knight 2 times and it was out of this world non stop action. Heath Ledger I tip my hat off to you. He was AMAZING, you'll always be in our hearts.</p><hr><p><b>Mark S</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>I went to see Batman Begins with only on the strength of Christopher Nolan, he really hasn't made a bad movie, the direction is always strong & he is a terrific screenwriter. As always Mr. Nolan doesn't disappoint at all. The shooting script is leaps & bounds over this one, but that's not to say this isn't worth a solid 9.</p><hr><p><b>TeRina</b> <img src=/images/rating/5-stars.gif> (5 out of 10 )<br>I didn't think it was that great. Christian Bale is a good actor but his voice for the Batman is quite annoying and it kind of gives him a bit of a lisp. Katie Holmes was really bad - no offense- so she didn't really send any vibes. Cillian Murphy was alright but he's not really the ideal bad guy, hes just in my view one of the extras. Joker which is coming up though, is Batman's main rival and is one of those people that you cant forget - hes that psycho! Everyone else did a pretty good job and Micheal Cain does a fantastic Alfred, so I give him a big thumbs up.</p><hr><p><b>Hanzo Barren</b> <a href="mailto:skcamou@hotmail.com" title="E-mail User"><img src="/images/emailuser.gif" border=0></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Unlike the previous Batman films, Begins brings more life and realism, reviving an American Icon and giving him more standards. The characters are real, not mediocre and cartoonish. Oh, and for the record, it is not Marvel, it's DC, get it right.</p><hr><p><b>Micheal Johnston</b> <a href="mailto:Michealmayhem@aol.com" title="E-mail User"><img src="/images/emailuser.gif" border=0></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>ImNotTellingYou~ Actually in the comic books, Joe Chill is the murderer of Bruce's parents. The Tim Burton film was the first time that the mythology of the Batman was changed to introduce that Jack Napier aka the Joker killed Thomas and Martha Wayne. Personally, I loved the mythology changes in this version of the Batman legend.</p><hr><p><b>Michelle</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Great movie. Christian Bale is a good Batman AND Bruce Wayne which is hard to come by. Katie Holmes is a disaster area and needs to be deleted from the movie. The villains were lacking, but it was fine. I mean, it's only the beginning of Batman. He can't have fifty villains all at once! Michael Caine does a fantastic job and his acting skills couldn't be better. Did I mention that Katie Holmes can't act and is terrible?</p><hr><p><b>Masked hero</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Easily one of the greatest DC comics to hit the big screen. Christian Bale gave a very memorable performance and the whole overall vibe of Batman and why he became Batman was very incredible. The Batman film franchise has been phenomenal thanks to Christopher Nolan and the great cast and crew. The Dark Knight was also a true masterpiece. Although I'm positive most people know that by now.</p><hr><p><b>Ammiel Thomas</b> <a href="mailto:ammielasthomas@yahoo.co.uk" title="E-mail User"><img src="/images/emailuser.gif" border=0></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>This film was good because of the script it showed the origins of Batman and explained the science behind his equipment. The cast was also good (mainly British I have to say) each actor picture perfect for the role. It was a good launch pad for its even more brilliant sequel the Dark Knight. </p><hr><p><b>Kyle</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>I absolutely loved this movie. It was the start of a whole line of Superhero movies that finally took themselves seriously (not to mention the brilliance that is The Dark Knight). It was interesting to read this somewhat dated draft of the movie because there are quite a few variants to the finished product. There were some things that I was glad they changed but somethings seemed like an interesting different direction for the scene. I especially enjoyed the slight reference to Harvey Dent. And I thought the dialogue between Bruce and Rachel at the end was interesting. I think I like how they changed it but it was still interesting. A good read. A greater movie.</p><hr><p><b>leslie</b> <a href="mailto:leslielandberg@yahoo.com" title="E-mail User"><img src="/images/emailuser.gif" border=0></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>My script editor recommended I read/see this film as he felt the treatment of the back story via flashback in the entire first act was a very capable treatment. He actually called it brilliant. Hmmph. This is just another stiff, overblown, wooden, shambling Hollywood confection. Time to find another editor.</p><hr><p><b>Pardeep</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Christian Bale was perfect for the role of Batman, best batman movie yet. Bale also trained for his perfect physique to play this role, within 6 months that's pretty impressive considering the change from a skinny guy in the machinist to bulky bruce wayne, he looked better than todays male models. Morgan Freeman, brilliant as usual as Lucius Fox, and Gary Oldman did well as Lt. Gordon and who better to play butler Alfred than our beloved Michael Caine.</p><hr><p><b>john</b> <a href="mailto:johnp34@live.com" title="E-mail User"><img src="/images/emailuser.gif" border=0></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Batman begins to be honest is such an interesting movie. I don't even know how to compare it but its content, genre and noir is fantastic.</p><hr><p><b>Andrew</b> <a href="mailto:andyforair@aol.com" title="E-mail User"><img src="/images/emailuser.gif" border=0></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>The thing about this movie was that it made batman realistic. I can relate to this movie more than I can relate to Burton's batman, which was also excellent, but not realistic. The worst batman director of all time was the one who thought of the batman nipples. Who was that?</p><hr><p><b>DanThe(Bat)Man</b> <img src=/images/rating/6-stars.gif> (6 out of 10 )<br>To be honest, this is my least favourite of the Batman movies. Just because it's my least favourite does it mean I absolutely hate it? No it doesn't, I like it, however it suffers from four main flaws. Two were forgiveable and two were unforgiveable, but one of the unforgiveables was made forgiveable in The Dark Knight. But one will remain unforgiveable no matter what. My initial reaction to this was the same as my impression of the '89 movie, where was Batman? It turned out to be a prequel and the first half was all about Bruce Wayne on his journey to become what he will be for the rest of his life. No for the flaws. Let's start with the forgiveable flaws. 1. The dialogue could get boring at times but at others could be very good so I will give the dialogue a break. 2. The Batmobile doesn't look like something Batman would drive. I looks more like an army tank. But the gadgets were cool so I consider it forgiveable. Now for The unforgiveable flaws. 3. The action scenes were terrible, worse than Batman & Robin's could ever be. There's too much shaky-cam. And I mean way too much. I goes way too fast and it leaves you dazed and confused. You're like "What's going on? STOP THE CAMERA!". The Dark Knight improved and gave some very good action scenes. And the biggest flaw of all: 4. Batman himself: he didn't looked bad, I think he looked quite good and I like the new Bat-Insignia (The symbol on his chest). But I absoloutely hate his voice. He sounds like a smoker with lung cancer being strangled. Christian Bale is my absolute personal worst Batman of all time, even worse than George Clooney could ever be. My thoughts on the cast: Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne/Batman was quite a good Bruce Wayne but an aweful Batman as I've already said. Katie Holmes as Rachael Dawes was alright, she didn't really do much. Much like Maggie Gyllenhaal as the same character in The Dark Knight. Michael Cain as Alfred Pennyworth was kind of good and a good update to Michael Gough's version of the character. But sometime I think he gets too preachy and always has a speech prepaired. Gary Oldman as Commisioner Gordon was very good and actually better than Pat Hingle. Mind you it wasn't Pat Hingle's fault because his Commisioner Gordon was written as useless and doesn't do much. Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox was also good as the one who provides the gadgets and actually gives Batman a cape made of a material that actually explains how he can glide. Now for The villains. Cillian Murphy as Dr. Jonathan Crane/The Scarecrow was, for me at least, the best villain. But the main villain was actually Liam Neeson as Henri Ducard/Ra's Al Ghul and he was alright. But I was kind of disappointed that he was the main villain. I was hoping more for The Scarecrow. But besides that he was alright. It's kind of bland at time but at others it could be quite good. I was originally going to give it a rating of five but since I'm feeling merciful, I'll give it a six. It's worth a watch.</p><hr><p><b>Joe</b> <a href="mailto:gi_joey1997@yahoo.co.uk" title="E-mail User"><img src="/images/emailuser.gif" border=0></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Great movie, great script, great cast! The Dark Night is better, and the The Dark Night Rises sounds even better. Maggie may I say Batman isn't done by Marvel its by DC comics jee wizz. And for some reason I can't seem to find the button which shows us the script.</p><hr><p><b>nit</b> <a href="mailto:n2463614@gmail.com" title="E-mail User"><img src="/images/emailuser.gif" border=0></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>Batman Begins is awesome. Ra's al Ghul was mysterious in this movie. After a long time I saw something creative in this movie like Tim Burton Batman movies. The entire movie is about fear, crime and revenge. Great stuff.</p><hr><p><b>Michael</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>It was an awesome movie. Really halped us forget the Joel Schumacher debocles.

Christian Bale all the way. Although, I didn't really like Katie Holmes, she didn't seem to have enough spark in her like the woman who played Rachel in The Dark Knight. But still, I think all movies are fantastic. Anne Hathaway played a great Catwoman, and Bane's eyes just told you all the emotions right then and there and the Joker was greatly played. Thanks Christopher Nolan and the entire cast.</p><hr><p><b>BendingWillough</b> <a href="mailto:bendingwillough@hotmail.com" title="E-mail User"><img src="/images/emailuser.gif" border=0></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>Wonderful script.

Really? Did you make some 10 minute youtube vid that was so god awful that you have to give good pieces of art negative reviews just so you can feel okay about your cheap piece of rat shit? And Danthe(bat)man you're just pathetic, the batmobile tank has been used in comics. The film is great, Bale plays Batman and Bruce better than the rest, the voice shows his smarts cause who in their right mind would use their real detectable voice? His was fearsome! The talk was great, you need to learn something about good film. And stop being so "since I'm merciful" bullshit you're just mad Batman and Robin sucks. And the fights were bad but that was like the only flaw.</p><hr></td>
