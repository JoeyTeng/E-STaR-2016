    <td colspan="4"><a name=comments></a><p><b>Raymond Scherrer</b> <a href="mailto:Darthray90@comcast.net" title="E-mail User"><img src="/images/emailuser.gif" border=0></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>Despite what other people might think, I believe Batman Forever to be a pretty good Batman film (second place in my opinion). I was glad to find the script online and I think AKiva Goldman has crafted a nice story with well-balanced action and human interest. However, Two-Face is turned from a sinister and tragic figure into a semi-Joker and the script shows how the Batman movie series turned from faithful to camp.</p><hr><p><b>Indie Brit</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>Ok lets get a few simple things straight. You who posted above me are well wrong. It is a dreadfull film, it is a dreadfull movie that not even Jim Carey himself could make decent. Tommy Lee Jones portrayal of Two Face it just plain wrong! This film is awfull and represents what is evil in Comic Book Film Adaptations</p><hr><p><b>Charsa</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>I thought this movie was really good. In fact, you are right, Brit. Jim Carey's character could've done a better job before he became The Riddler. I didn't like the way the face was made for Tommy Lee Jones. 

"This is your brain on the box. This is my brain on the box. Does anybody else feel like a fried egg?" - The Riddler. That quote cracks me up. 

It's gonna be so much fun when Batman Begins comes to this site!</p><hr><p><b>Patrick</b> <a href="mailto:pcsigurd@mn.rr.com" title="E-mail User"><img src="/images/emailuser.gif" border=0></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Indie Brit, I'm sorry but I'm gonna have to disagree with you there. This movie was a great movie. Batman and Robin was the dreadful movie, not this one.  They chose the perfect Riddler (Jim Carrey), a good Two-Face (Tommy Lee Jones) and a very good Batman (Val Kilmer).</p><hr><p><b>Omkar</b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>This was a pretty good movie but it was not better than Batman and Robin. I thought the first Batman was the best and this one was tied with the second. I thought they picked a good Riddler and Two-Face but I think Val Kilmer did not do really, really good as Batman.</p><hr><p><b>Ryan</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>That's just crazy, it's a widely known fact that "Batman and Robin" was a complete disgrace and instead of showing the dark, sinister atmosphere meant to be portrayed in a Batman film, it created a Gotham more like Alice in Wonderland or something. But thank god we have "Batman Begins" now which has wiped my memory of such flops. On the issue of Batman Forever I thought it was a decent film but you can still see the transition slowing taking place which leads to Batman and Robin.</p><hr><p><b>sophie</b> <img src=/images/rating/2-stars.gif> (2 out of 10 )<br>No no no. This script is plain awful! Some of the one-liners just make you want to cringe! Plus, the acting is really bad in this.</p><hr><p><b>Tom Cruise</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>Chase was too sexy!</p><hr><p><b>Marquise</b> <img src=/images/rating/5-stars.gif> (5 out of 10 )<br>Ok, some people tend to complain that this movie was "extremely bad." Bad? Yes. Extremely bad? No. There WERE some good, or at least halfway decent, parts to this flick: Nicole Kidman as Dr. Chase Meridian. Need I say more, folks? Tommy Lee Jones as Two-Face. HE DID NOT OVERACT. Why people say this, I may never know, but I emphasize, HE DID NOT OVERACT. He did pretty good, really. Sure, he wasn't one dark, evil, no good son of a gun, but he had that evil hint to him that made you wonder what he was capable of. Now, for the bad stuff: The introduction of Robin. TOO SOON! Val Kilmer as Batman/Bruce Wayne. Now, I am not saying that he did a bad performance, because he did an exceptional performance, but I wasn't really ready to change from Michael Keaton to Val Kilmer and it kind of hurt the entire process for me. Jim Carrey as the Riddler/Edward Nygma. Now he DID overact. Just like he does in EVERY movie he plays in. But relax, folks, they only get worse.</p><hr><p><b>Chase's guy</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Sorry Sophie, but that is a terrible comment. Chase was the sexiest and this was the greatest movie in the whole wide world. I think this film should win like twenty-two oscars for god sake!</p><hr><p><b>Batman</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>It's a bad film; the one liners ARE terrible, the jokes aren't funny, and Robin is the world's biggest fool (the bit with the kung-fu style laundry is just stupid), but you've got to love it. It's so bad it's funny! Batman's a legend, and you know it.</p><hr><p><b>Stephen</b> <a href="mailto:stephenmj12@yahoo.com" title="E-mail User"><img src="/images/emailuser.gif" border=0></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>That 7 is only for the character of Two-Face. This draft is completely different than what played in the movie. THIS Harvey Dent seemed a lot more serious, I'm not saying he's not cheesy and campy at times, but compared to Tommy Lee Jones in the film, this is much more mature. I would imagine must closer to the comics. I liked a lot of aspects of THIS Two Face.</p><hr><p><b>Chen</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>I like the first movie best and I like Michael Keaton as Batman. Val Kilmer did a great job too, especially the part describing his 'bad dreams'. Only that the joker and the two-faced are too similar, although Tom Lee Jones acted well. Jim Carrey kept his own style....it's up to your taste. Nicole Kidman and Drew Barrymore are sexy and Chris O gave a novelty, his chemistry with Val is quite impressive, making the movie better then the second one. The dark, sinister atmosphere is more balanced than 2rd movie as it add a young element (Robin). PS - Batman and Robin makes Batman a joke!</p><hr><p><b>XDL</b> <img src=/images/rating/3-stars.gif> (3 out of 10 )<br>Below average, definitely, but still another enjoyable Batman film. Watchable, and Tommy Lee Jones is good as always. The main quarrel is how ridiculously over the top everything is, when Batman demands at least a partial degree of subtlety, but at least it's better than Batman and Robin.</p><hr><p><b>hordriss the confuser</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>One word about the design of this film... NEON! I liked the look of this film. I especially liked how they cut part of Nigma's experiment scene for the DVD release. Two face was not faithful to the original comics, but I still liked the interpretation. Chase Meridian... woah! Val Kilmer was pretty solid, although Chis O'Donnel seemed like a bit of a twerp in places. Jim Carey stole the show, with a performance heavily inspired by the 60's TV show's version of the Riddler. Just deep enough to keep your brain ticking over, with an nice subplot about Bruce Wayne deciding between being himself and Batman, which interplays nicely with the main plot throughout.
The action sequences and stunts were impressive without resorting to complete lunacy (MI2, anyone?). One final note: Where does Two Face hire all his goons? Can you imagine the advert "Wanted: large men with mediocre fighting ability to wield fluorescent machine guns and operate assorted vehicles. Ludicrous piercings and criminal record essential. Cover for medical, dental, and psychiatric care not included. Proof of life insurance required". I don't think it's fair to compare either The Dark Knight or Batman Begins with Batman Forever. They are on entirely different wavelengths. I rate this second only to the first Tim Burton version (we shall not speak of the 60's film based on the TV series, hehe).</p><hr><p><b>Glen Lantz</b> <a href="mailto:sanjuanslasher2005@yahoo.com" title="E-mail User"><img src="/images/emailuser.gif" border=0></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=/images/rating/6-stars.gif> (6 out of 10 )<br>This film isn't entirely horrible. In fact, I've been able to watch it in front of other people (which says a lot for me). But I view the modern-day Batman series as three different franchises. Burton, Schumaucer, and Nolan. They're all completely different things.</p><hr><p><b>aydin</b> <img src=/images/rating/3-stars.gif> (3 out of 10 )<br>I thought the gotham city in batman forever was too vertical. massive skyscrapers, narrow streets, not to mention Harvey Dent's face. It looks way too leather. When I saw this the first time it didn't really do anything for me. Much the same as batman and robin, what a shit movie. Batman the dark knight is by far the best batman showing how Harvey became two face and it ties in nicely with the very first batman when we see the emergence of the joker.</p><hr><p><b>Emma_Nygma</b> <a href="mailto:emmamunday241@hotmail.com" title="E-mail User"><img src="/images/emailuser.gif" border=0></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>I myself absolutely loved Batman Forever. I thought Val Kilmer did a ok job given the directing tips from Joel S. I thought Jim Carrey was a perfect Riddler,despite what people say (He is Jim Carrey, he doesn't overact - he performs...) and TLJ as Two-Face was good also (also Eckhart did better in my opinion, in portraying Dent first and then leading to Two-Face). AND - it's so neon colourful xD! Beautiful...

</p><hr><p><b>DanThe(Bat)Man</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I loved this as a child and still do now. This remains my favourite Batman movie to date. Val Kilmer was a good Batman, Tommy Lee Jones was a great Two-Face, Jim Carrey as The Riddler was hilarious as ever, Nichole Kidman was sexy as hell as Dr. Chase Meridian and Chris O'Donnell did a great update to Burt Ward's Robin.</p><hr><p><b>rightside</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>Batman Forever was a horrible film. They took Tim Burton's dark, gothic feel and turned it into a neon nightmare. Not only did the sets ruin the feel of Gotham, but the overly silly portrayal of the villains added with the nipples on the batsuit turned this movie into a comedic dud. Don't even get me started on the horrific design of the bat vehicles. Thank God Nolan saved the series with the Dark Knight films.</p><hr><p><b>Heather Holder</b> <a href="mailto:starfire3372@yahoo.com" title="E-mail User"><img src="/images/emailuser.gif" border=0></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I don't care what anyone said THIS IS MY FAVORITE movie. I love the actor choices in here I love the riddles, I love the plot, I love the psychology and over all I just love batman he's my favorite hero and has been since I was a young child I love everything about this movie, and like all amazing movies there's its credits who try to bring it down and feed to much in it, I find it funny, exciting, romantic, heroic. I honestly love this movie so much some of the comments on here kind of make me just a touch upset which is personally out of character to me. @Indie Brit I love his twoface even more than the one in dark knight and I like the little comic book follow-up that is what its based off you know. @Omkar I honestly love him as batman he fits the rich strong mysterious profile perfect, you're crazy to think not @sophie the one liners are a comicbook thing. @Marquise The movie want bad all and Jim Carrie it AMAZING but I agree twoface was done well he has multiple personalities which I would like to see more of but as someone who works with them they do act that extreme.@ Batman O. O I love robin he's amazing and his moves are awesome. I am 100% bias on this movie, I love everything about it and you really can't change my mind :D I get childish when it comes to this movie.</p><hr><p><b>Batgirl452</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I think that all the batman movies are fantastic. I am a teenager and I even love the older films. Batman is by far the best superhero. Heather you are probably one of my favorite people right now because of how much you love this film just sayin'.</p><hr><p><b>Liam Rush</b> <a href="mailto:liamrush@hotmail.com" title="E-mail User"><img src="/images/emailuser.gif" border=0></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I thought that Batman Forever captured the imagination and made it not as serious as I thought it was and most of that is due to the fact that Jim Carrey being the comedian he is was like Batman and Bruce Almightly swirled into a nice soup and the flavour was delicious.</p><hr><p><b>nicholas</b> <a href="mailto:suppanicky" title="E-mail User"><img src="/images/emailuser.gif" border=0></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>Batman forever was a good movie it was just weird that jim carrey was a bad guy.</p><hr></td>
