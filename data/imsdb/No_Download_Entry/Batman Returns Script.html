It's the first time the series goes off the rails.  Sure, it got worse later on, but Waters is the man who really killed Batman.  Thanks a lot, Daniel.

At least it has some good lines - the best one of which was cut out in the end, and was stolen from Hamm's much better attempt.

Juvenile pop-psychology, zero continuity to the first one, typically lame Waters-ian "observations" on "All-American shallowness", or whatever he calls it.  So many writers were waiting to do so much better.</p><hr><p><b>James</b> <a href="mailto:mnees@cardcaa.org" title="E-mail User"><img src="/images/emailuser.gif" border=0></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>This film was absolutely amazing. My favorite is Batman Begins but my second is Tim Burton's. I love that it is so dark it upsets your stomach watching it. Most definitely when the Penguin comes out of the sewage water at the end with gory black blood coming out of his mouth. And if the film wasn't good enough yet adding Christopher Walken to the film just made it richer. I would have gave it ten stars but Michelle Pfeiffer messed it up. She was OK, better than Katie Holmes in Batman Begins. But most of the time she sort of ruined some of it except for the night she became Catwoman that was BRILLIANT.</p><hr><p><b>Thea</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>No way, she didn't ruin it. I believe she carried most of the drama in that film. She was basically playing two roles. My God, was she awesome as Catwoman... much better than Halle was. Why even compare her to Katie Holmes?</p><hr><p><b>Omkar</b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>It was a great movie. Danny Divito was the best actor in this movie. Michael Keaton also did really good as Batman.</p><hr><p><b>Richard</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Hands down, one of my all time FAVORITE movies!</p><hr><p><b>Marquise</b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>Michael Keaton, once again, as it shouldn't be a shocker anyway, portrays Batman/Bruce Wayne to a tee, folks. Sure, he could show a little bit more remorse as Batman in the flick, but that is what makes it so dark, the way that Keaton sets the mood once he puts that suit on. Impressive. Danny DeVito, well, I could go on a big long tirade but I'll keep it short and try to watch my language. I have never been a fan of him, and I probably never will be. This is one flick where he actually tried to play the role right-- AND HE TRIED TOO HARD, AND COMPLETELY FLUBBED IT UP! Michelle Pfieffer, I'm not going to push my luck, but I will say that MAN, she looked good in that Catwoman suit! Nothing more needs to be said. And Christopher Walken is just Christopher Walken. Nobody plays a dark character or a warped minded character any better. Tim Burton does it again. While this one may not be the best in the series, it is definitely the second best, only behind the original Batman.</p><hr><p><b>crysti</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>I'm glad they didn't use this one and have selina die because I don't know if I could've taken it! She's my all time favorite movie character (and my trademark at costume parties).</p><hr><p><b>azrael</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Burton's batman really fitted in well for the big screen, in that instead of having a big bodybuilder play the part of bats he chose to cast Michael Keaton and have him don the suit to make up for his small figure. A good element that really worked.</p><hr><p><b>Paola</b> <a href="mailto:chica-star-8@hotmail.com" title="E-mail User"><img src="/images/emailuser.gif" border=0></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>Batman was a great movie, but it started boring.</p><hr><p><b>Dizzygirl</b> <a href="mailto:beach_dizzy@yahoo.com" title="E-mail User"><img src="/images/emailuser.gif" border=0></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Since this is a movie about a comic book super hero, you can't expect it to be true to life. I enjoyed this movie very much. Christian Bale is one actor that I think is very under rated and is amazing in this role. It was better than the first three batman movies and I am dieing for the sequal. Good job on this one. Awesome movie.</p><hr><p><b>Tormentor</b> <a href="mailto:nave_miller@hotmail.com" title="E-mail User"><img src="/images/emailuser.gif" border=0></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Batman Returns is by far the best Batman flick out there. Not only does it stay true to Bob Kane's vision of a dark and gothic city, it has all the makings of a perfect tragedy with indepth character degeneration. I am surprised to see that most people are very negative about this movie, when this was one of the most matured Batman portrayals of all time. It perfected upon the shortcomings of the first movie and gave us a BATMAN more true to his dark and silent personage than even Nolan in his 'realistic noir-influenced Begins'. Catwoman was perhaps portrayed almost uncannily by Michelle Pfeiffer and is satisfyingly THE best female counterpart in all of the Batman incarnations. Add that to Tim Burton's cold, unforgiving infatuations with tragic figures and 'gothic' world, and you have a Batman movie at its finest. The gradual development of Selina Kyle and Penguin's characters throughout the film, though hated by many for upstaging the Dark Knight, is in fact the basis of a fine sequel. And the best part is that we really don't see a true 'villain' at all, but several characters force-fed by the cruelties of society. As per dialog, the characterization was flawless. Although Returns is  a Batman flick, it cannot simply be compared with the work Nolan did on Begins as the two movies are very distinct in their themes, genres and even style of portrayals. And c'mon! Where else did we get the sexiest female femme fatale of comic books spring to life so vividly? The transformation from mild-mannered 'lonely secretary' to visceral eccentric dominatrix? And it was this movie that made Penguin cool again, solidified Batman's silent persona, inspired Bruce Timm, included Danny Elfman's classic piece, and set around a white, blood-less city with opportunist business tycoons and a failing political stability. A portrayal of social discrimination and above all; an unmoved Dark Knight distracted by love, driven with a purpose and faced against a madman trying to kill off innocent first-born sons! Sam Hamm's script had an overall stale reliving of the first movie, with a climax set in Wayne Manor and a very flawed Catwoman. Burton rocked the world with this movie, it was only a shame that the idiots sitting behind the studio felt that the franchise needed to be 'kiddied up' for this being too 'dark' a theme for children. Thought of the children did they? Well then what are we having now in 2008? The decision to make the franchise more child-friendly only resulted in utter annihilation of the franchise itself, and NOW they turn to a noir-scribe to establish a 'serious and realistic' Gotham City... I say the real tragedy was that the studio had failed to see Tim Burton's greatness and failed to act on it for another original sequel...   </p><hr><p><b>Steven Murray</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is without a doubt the best Batman movie out there. Begins is good but rather dull. This is interesting from beginning to end and captures the mood of Batman and Gotham City brilliantly. Michael Keaton is fantastic as Batman and no-one will ever surpass him in the role. The real sat is Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman however, her performance is purrfect. Playing the dual identity of Selina and Catwoman, she has the hardest job, as her character descends into madness with want for revenge. She performs all her own stunts and the performances between her and Keaton are fantastic, filled with lust and tragedy. Danny Devito is also fantastic as the Penguin and Christopher Walken is amazing as Pfeiffer's nemesis, the odious Max Shreck. Again though, it is when Michelle Pfeiffer is on screen that the movie lights up. Tim Burton delivered one of his best movies here. MEOW!</p><hr><p><b>Tyler</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>I liked the Returns, but my favorite character was Selina Kyle/Catwoman. I also liked Danny Devito in one of his best performances. But back to Catwoman, I liked the whole magical cat woman creation part, I think it is a good idea, but I just wish they showed her making the costume, and in the script she becomes Catwoman in the morning, I just wish they showed it that way. But it's still a good movie.</p><hr><p><b>luchio</b> <a href="mailto:martoforever@hotmail.com" title="E-mail User"><img src="/images/emailuser.gif" border=0></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=/images/rating/5-stars.gif> (5 out of 10 )<br>Sometimes I'm not sure what to think about this one. It's not Batman, that's the problem. It's Burton's world with some characters dressed as Batman's. Strange, but still has its moments. I don't either love or hate this movie. It's just strange and a lil emo by the way, long before emos ruled the world.</p><hr><p><b>DanThe(Bat)Man</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>I like this film. It's not my best but it's still good. Michael Keaton is still the best Batman in my opinion. He could kick Christian Bale's butt anyday. While I didn't like the '89 movie as a child, for some strange reason, I liked this one better. I'm not really sure why, but I still liked it. I still like it now, but not as much as I used to. However it's still a fun, dark ride.</p><hr><p><b>Matt</b> <a href="mailto:ews_ny@yahoo.com" title="E-mail User"><img src="/images/emailuser.gif" border=0></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>James you don't know what you're talking about, Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman IS what made this movie. Her interpretation is the one to beat and no other actress, not even Anne Hathaway, has come close to being as good. She owned that part.</p><hr><p><b>Alex</b> <a href="mailto:aaranovak63@att.net" title="E-mail User"><img src="/images/emailuser.gif" border=0></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>Let be honest when we rank Batman films: 1: The Dark Knight. 2: The Dark Knight Rises. 3: Batman Begins. 4: Batman. 5: Batman Returns. 6: Batman Forever. 7: Batman And Robin. And with the actors who have portrayed Batman: 1: Christian Bale. 2: Michaels Keaton. 3: Ben Affleck, He is already better than the Batman by Kilmer and Clooney. 4: Val Kilmer. 5: George Clooney. Best Villain: Heath Ledger As The Joker. Nolan was the best director by far. Be real.</p><hr></td>
