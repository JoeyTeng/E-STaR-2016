I would say Batman Begins is better as a movie but this is a better superhero movie. Best superhero movie ever probably.</p><hr><p><b>JC</b> <a href="mailto:knoxville_element69@hotmail.com" title="E-mail User"><img src="/images/emailuser.gif" border=0></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I wouldn't say batman begins is better than Dark Knight omkar, but they are both great. The dark knight in my opinion is definitely the best super hero movie ever made. Not only that, it is one of the best movies ever made. The greatest villain in screen history, some of the most fantastic action sequences ever, fantastic music score, amazing performances from all, and one of the memorable scenes in history (the interrogation room scene with batman and joker). Actually that would be two memorable scenes, not forgetting the opening bank heist. And with all it remains realistic. I'm telling ya, if you didn't like this movie, take my advice, don't plan a career in film making.</p><hr><p><b>Tom Garvey</b> <a href="mailto:tomgarvey@btinternet.com" title="E-mail User"><img src="/images/emailuser.gif" border=0></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>One of the best films I have ever seen. The best superhero film of all time, but the best thing about it is the late Heath Ledger's performace as the Joker. If you want a film with a really psychopathic and intriguing villain, look no further than 'The Dark Knight'.</p><hr><p><b>jdkarlowich</b> <a href="mailto:jkarlowich.08@colby-sawyer.edu" title="E-mail User"><img src="/images/emailuser.gif" border=0></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>There was a time after Batman and Robin when Warner Bros. and DC Comics were unsure about making another Batman film, but when Christopher Nolan and David S. Goyer came along they brought a new take, being more realistic and dark. Christian Bale was an awesome choice as Bruce Wayne and Batman, while Heath Ledger's Joker is far more sinister and closer to the comic book. Ledger even becomes superior over Jack Nicholson and Cesar Romero. Nolan's possibilities for the third is already expected, while we can only wait to see how The Riddler would be depicted.</p><hr><p><b>Celestin Haerens</b> <a href="mailto:haerenscelestin@gmail.com" title="E-mail User"><img src="/images/emailuser.gif" border=0></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Great read, but this was to be expected after seeing the movie. It was nice to see how some of the dialogue is different from the final cut. The actors really brought the written words to life. Noticed one small deleted scene (Joker in his car, after the fundraiser scene) and some minor differences from the final movie. Great plot, great dialogue, great characters. In short: it's a Nolan brothers movie. It's a great story. It's a great movie.</p><hr><p><b>Waleed Ahmed</b> <a href="mailto:thevirus_tv@ymail.com" title="E-mail User"><img src="/images/emailuser.gif" border=0></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Hats off to the late Heath Ledger for his magnificent performance and of course to the director of this movie Mr Christopher Nolan. Joker was always my favorite character, that's why I was a little worried that Mr Ledger could do a bad job but he simply stole this movie and he had done a better job than Christian Bale. I believe that Heath Ledger must be nominated for the BEST ACTOR IN A LEADING ROLE in OSCAR & GOLDEN GLOBE for his everlasting performance in this movie.</p><hr><p><b>Claire</b> <a href="mailto:fallonce@comcast.net" title="E-mail User"><img src="/images/emailuser.gif" border=0></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie was fantastic! It had so many twists and turns that surprised me. The late Heath Ledger did such a great job of portraying the Joker, to the point of which it was practically perfect!</p><hr><p><b>Leo Astudillo</b> <a href="mailto:leonideastudillo" title="E-mail User"><img src="/images/emailuser.gif" border=0></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Amazing film, amazing script. I am a filmmaking student myself and I can only hope to be able to write as good as Mr. Nolan in the future.</p><hr><p><b>jackdaddy</b> <a href="mailto:jackosurfing14@hotmail.com" title="E-mail User"><img src="/images/emailuser.gif" border=0></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is simply my favorite movie and one of the best movies ever made. I love the characters of psychopaths (travis bickle taxi driver, jake ma lotta raging bull, Alex a clockwork oranger, Mr pink reservoir dogs, Hugo stigwiltz inglorious basterds) but heath ledger performance as the joker tops them all, a psychotic clown who knows exactly what he is doing who shows people who they really are. Christian bale is superb as batman and people stop whining about his voice HE NEEDS TO KEEP HIS SECRET IDENTITY. Aaron echart is perfect as the white knight. Direction is amazing by christopher nolan who has to be regarded as the best director of the decade and should have at least got an oscar nomination for the dark knight. Hanz zimmer and james newton scores are awesome, especially the music when the joker explains how he got his scars it creates the perfect tension and when the batman is stopping the swat teams. This movie is blockbuster entertainment with one of the best ending of all time which sums up the meaning of The Dark knight. Can't wait for the next one.</p><hr><p><b>Ammiel aka 8mm</b> <a href="mailto:ammielasthomas@yahoo.com" title="E-mail User"><img src="/images/emailuser.gif" border=0></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>What can I say, this was an absolute brilliant movie experience, I didn't want to leave my seat for a moment and it felt like the film would never end. It was more than just a good film though it asked a lot of moral questions and showed that as a society we can't afford to be manipulated by fear and mad men or give into terrorist demands. It made me realise we can't be passive and allow cruel people to decide how our world is run. Brilliant peformances from all actors especially the late great Heathe Ledger who helped reaffirm what career I want to take which is screenplay writing and screen acting.</p><hr><p><b>evan M</b> <a href="mailto:ewmoc@hotmail.com" title="E-mail User"><img src="/images/emailuser.gif" border=0></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie was awesome. Great writing, but most of all Heath Ledger's preformance is outstanding as the Joker! Some kids at my old school said this was the worst Batman they've seen. They're crazy.</p><hr><p><b>Film Critic 12</b> <a href="mailto:jasonedwards1219@yahoo.com" title="E-mail User"><img src="/images/emailuser.gif" border=0></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>There are a lot of pricks I know who are always saying Jack Nicholson was better. I got four words: NO HE WAS NOT. He was scary but annoying. Ledger did two things: make him believable and make me scared of pencils. He was awesome! Better than Nicholson? Hell Yeah.</p><hr><p><b>Kyle</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I had just finished reading Sam Hamm's Batman and Batman 2 when I began reading this. And it made me realize how much of a difference it makes when the writer is a part of the production (especially as the director). Reading Hamm's scripts I could see where they took a couple lines here and a couple ideas there and put them into the finished product. But for the Dark Knight, the script and the movie are almost identical. Even down to the action scenes which usually change depending on the location and fight choreographer. It makes you realize how strong a team the Nolan brothers are. I would not have liked Hamm's scripts if they had made them word-for-word into movies. They needed outside input to make them watchable. But reading the Dark Knight gave me chills. I would recommend to everyone to read this script. Or. Just watch the movie! Even better.</p><hr><p><b>chris</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The Dark Knight is without a doubt one of the greatest films ever made. It should be viewed and dissected by anyone who has the intention of becoming a film maker or writer. As an aspiring screenwriter, the dark knight is what inspired me to start looking at movies in a different way, from the way dialog is written to creating characters who have to make difficult choices and the lasting effects those choices can have. And Heath Ledgers memorable performance is the cherry on top of the cake. Now, nearly two years later, I have learned a lot about how I write my screenplays, and I owe a lot of this to The Dark Knight. Movies don't get much better than this one.</p><hr><p><b>Aniruddha</b> <a href="mailto:lendula@gmail.com" title="E-mail User"><img src="/images/emailuser.gif" border=0></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I had not expected a batman movie to be so good. But I was speechless throughout the movie in the theatre. This is the most amazing movie ever. It has everything you want from a superhero movie. Amazing work. Hats off.</p><hr><p><b>RPG Hill</b> <a href="mailto:tuxedomask_477@hotmail.com" title="E-mail User"><img src="/images/emailuser.gif" border=0></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>My guess is you guys aren't going to like what I'm about to say here. So here goes, The Dark Knight was not the greatest film ever it was up there as far as films go though. I would say this is the best superhero film, the only thing is you are all praising Heath Ledgers perfomance. Are any of you thinking about the actual film, or the writer's/director of the film? Heath Ledger was amazing in this movie as the Joker, but how were all the other actors perfomances? I think everyone rode with this film just off of Heath. I think it was very well written and very well directed, however there are films out there that ar far superior to it. I will agree that I loved that movie and it was all around a good film just not the best ever like everyone is saying. Then agian this is only an opinion and I'm sure a lot of people are about to go off on it. RIP Heath Ledger though he was an amazing actor all around. Personally I didn't like the whole switch from Katie Holmes that tore the core of the Dark Knight apart I felt. Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent/Two Face was pretty good, although I didn't care for the fact that they supposidly killed him off at the end of the film. Two Face didn't even have enough screen time as the villian they could have at least given him the next movie to develop more. Personally I think that as Batman said to Gordan "Harvey Dent is dead to Gotham." He said Harvey Dent he didn't say anythign about Two Face so I think Two Face is in Arkham. Just my opinion though, all the actors are keeping the info tight on the third and supposidly final instalment of the franchise. I actually have to say other than Ledgers performace and the pure chemestry between him as the Joker and Bale as the Batman, that I think Batman Begins was much better. Why do I think Begins was better? It's simple Liam Neeson as Ra's Al Ghoul however that's written? Anyway he was great and the origin of Batman they actually did it right and made it look so acceptional, not to mention Cillian Murphy as the Scarecrow. They made that movie so well. Anyway that's just my two cents on the matter, you guys enjoy discussing it more now.

One of the best adaption from comic book to big screen. Without a doubt I would say chris nolan as the best director of our time.</p><hr><p><b>Andrew Haxley</b> <a href="mailto:haxleyandrew@yahoo.com" title="E-mail User"><img src="/images/emailuser.gif" border=0></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This was a great film, The Dark Knight is a great film and also is very dark and depressing indeed. But mostly scary and Violent as it should be. This is not just your average kid's film as it focuses on a lot of dark violence, Scary explosions, Scar stories, And more. I liked Batman Begins and enjoyed seeing it first before The Dark Knight came out on DVD in 2008. It was the best film of the Year and is very scary like it should be. But this also focuses on Heath Ledger's performance and talent as the sadistic clown with no rules and no empathy at all. And he is a man of his word and says anarchy and chaos. And of course he is the Agent of Chaos. But mostly this film focuses on the battle between good and evil. Nothing could top off Ledger's talent or his amazing role as The Joker as it's not compared to that silly Ceaser Romero Joker or Jack Nicholson Joker in the 1989 Batman film. It's more brutal, Violent, Sadistic, And of course the main reason I decided to see this film is because of how good the dark tone is thrown into the film and how creepy it is compared to Batman Begins with the same theme in it but a dark twist and a sadistic clown who is scary and more menacing then Ever. Harvey Dent and Rachel Dawes are good in this film as they work together to protect Gotham City from corruption and scums like The Scarecrow's henchman and The Joker, All together the film centers on Bruce Wayne as he becomes Batman to stop The Joker yet in this film. And also Gary Oldman as Jim Gordon is just awesome at his Role and he works for the Gotham City Police Department to bring down psychos like The Joker. And also Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent and Maggie Gyllenhal as Rachel Dawes is excellent. And is not compared to Katie Holmes who is actually in the First Film. She's smart this time and is not like Katie Holmes at all. And Aaron Eckhart who plays as the District Attorney Harvey Dent is awesome. But the main reason I always wanted to see this type of film is because of Christopher Nolan, Now Christopher Nolan is the most famous director behind the first film of Batman Begins and who also made The Dark Knight. Plus he made more films such as Memento, The Prestige, Following, And more, But he's also the best director that gave praise and power to this Superhero film. The greatest darkest feel to the film is when Harvey Dent says you either Die a Hero, Or you live yourself long Enough to become the villain. But he worked with Jonathan Nolan to bring the script into the film making it more darker and realistic. But also worked with Heath Ledger who was a lot better and made more money then Christian Bale did. But still they both did a good job none the less. R.I.P. Heath Ledger was still the best actor when he was still around. But I'm surprised how he even shows the city and the people of Gotham who they really are. There are many violent and scary scenes with The Joker, Like the scene where he talks to the Mob about Batman, And the part where he crashes Harvey Dent's party fund-raiser. But most importantly his scar stories and about how he got them to which he explains to his male victims about the Father story, While the female victims about his Mother. But the part where he threatens Rachel Dawes with a knife is just fantastic. But what can you expect. Heath Ledger's talent and his greatest performance in the film have to be remembered by everyone who sees it themselves. He's well talented and really smart as he sets up traps for Batman. He got a Golden Globe and Oscar for his role and performance as The Joker. And Heath Ledger's work has been amazing. Not only has he acted pretty well but also on the other hand spectacular like in the pencil trick scene where he kills a thug by ramming his head onto the table which brought my attention pretty quickly. But Jack Nicholson's Joker was not scary and was silly. But Heath's Joker is more creepy and more serious about things that he sees from his point of view. Christian Bale on the other hand as Batman and Bruce Wayne does a great job acting in his role throughout the film, His talent and performance are just as awesome here as it was in Batman Begins, But his acting was top notch and how he was fighting the swat team was just something amazing to see, And fighting The Joker's henchman by himself is awesome. This is one of his best performances yet and all I can say is that he deserves a lot of respect and credit for his role. But the bank robbery scene and hospital scene in this film are just awesome. They look pretty realistic and capture the look and setting pretty well. So if you want to see this film then go ahead. It's the best blockbuster film of all time and also is an awesome masterpiece as one of Nolan's work. See it for yourself and see what you think of it.</p><hr><p><b>Kapil</b> <a href="mailto:kapilkurlekar@gmail.com" title="E-mail User"><img src="/images/emailuser.gif" border=0></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The best superhero movie ever! The flow the movie has, the pace at which the story moves is absolutely fantastic. The performance of the Joker is legendary now. What I absolutely love is the background score. And the dialogs. The story Alfred tells Master Wayne about the bandit is Burma. WOW! Sums up the entire movie. The best movie of the decade.</p><hr><p><b>Mohit</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Every now and then, there comes an actor who changes the way the character is played. Heath Ledger.</p><hr><p><b>DJ</b> <a href="mailto:dmnmrx@hotmail.com" title="E-mail User"><img src="/images/emailuser.gif" border=0></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>All these 10 out of 10s make me sick. This movie was good, but still lacking in comparison to Begins, and far from perfect. I'm only hoping The Dark Knight Rises makes up for the weak areas in this film. For the record, I am not a fan of Bale as Wayne/Batman. He just plays it too 'blah' for me. And his Batman growl is annoying as hell. That being said, Batman Begins and the original '89 Batman are tied on my list for top Batfilms. Though Ledger gets props for bringing something fresh to the table, The Joker Blogs managed to take what Ledger did with the role and flesh it out even more, making it much more enjoyable of a watch for me than The Dark Knight.</p><hr><p><b>Cameron </b> <a href="mailto:darthsitkur@aol.com " title="E-mail User"><img src="/images/emailuser.gif" border=0></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The dark knight is chock full of intense action and one of the best action movies ever, and it was more of a shoot em up crime action thriller than a superhero flick, and of course the best part of the dark knight was Heath ledger.</p><hr><p><b>Dark Knight</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The performances were brilliant from all the cast members.

Thanks to the gift of gasoline and a little ammonium nitrate I'm ready right now to blow you all sky high. Each of you has the remote to blow up the other boat. Anyone attempts to get off their boat I blow you all up. At midnight I blow you all up. If however one of you blows the other boat up I'll let that boat live. So who's it going to be: Harvey Dent's Collection Of Gotham's Most Wanted Scumbags or The Sweet And Innocent Civilians. You choose. Oh and you might want to decide quickly because the people on the other boat may not be so noble. Who would you blow up?</p><hr><p><b>Brandon James Croker</b> <a href="mailto:bcroker@austin.rr.com" title="E-mail User"><img src="/images/emailuser.gif" border=0></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Such a masterpiece of filmmaking! Everything is done right, the casting, the writing, the effects, the action sequences, the writing! A great movie classic that I'm sure will be adored by many generations to come.</p><hr></td>
