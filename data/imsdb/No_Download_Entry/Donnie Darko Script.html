Can neone explain that to me?
</p><hr><p><b>Max</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>GREAT MOVIE!!! But I'm glad of the changes from this script to the finished movie, it works a lot better. But they shouldn't have taken out so much for the original, the director's cut is way better.</p><hr><p><b>Drakis</b> <a href="mailto:doom_drummer@hotmail.com" title="E-mail User"><img src="/images/emailuser.gif" border=0></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Good.  Very good.  There's something about this movie that has created an immense fandom of devoted watchers.  I introduced this movie to many of my friends who have now watched it many times over now, always loving every second of it.  I think the fact it includes Religion in a very broad fashion, sci-fi, drama but above all; the mysterious aspect of the movie.  

Speaking of the drama, Kudos to Gary Jules on his interpretation of "tears for fears"'s Mad World, which is very well used in the movie.  The very emotional end seems to fit perfectly with the issues the characters have gone through in the "future" as they seem to all recal some of it.  Which brings me to yet another point;  The acting.

Flawless.  Amazing actors, not all well knowned but exceedingly telented.  They vehiculated their feelings with a devoted passion, as well as the hints of irony Mr. Kelly introduced in the picture (to state an example; quote from Miss Farmer: " Sometimes I doupt your devotion to sparkle motion"). The facial expressions of often distorted smiles or the odd configurations of the character's faces as they cry or get angry and even when they seem puzzled  seem surreal yet strangely natural.

I don't think I need to add more.  I could go on, stating some random flaws, but they're all insignificant in relation with the whole movie.  Many more aspects of this brilliant film need to be praised, but I don't have time right now...  So I'll leave you with this ironic fact:  The song, Killing moon, at the begining of the original movie, was written by a band called Echo and the BUNNYMEN...

And I'm also going to recommend some movies they have on this site:  Notely "Fight Club" and " A Clockwork Orange" (not for the squeemish)  or anything by Tim Burton, although it's always better to look at his movies than read them...  And reading star wars is always good too, you know.</p><hr><p><b>Darko</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>If you film something in 2001 it can be that the movie plays in 1988. You know, just like you can film whatever is happened in the middle ages. Richard Kelly desided that he want the movie in 1988 =)

I love the movie, It's my favorite movie and I recommanded it to a lot of people =)
The only reason he doesn't get a 10 from me is, because I don't give any 10. Nothing is perfect. And to me 10 is perfect.
The movie is just great, it has something magical, that atracs me to the movie. You don't get the movie immediatly and that's a good point. In the movie there are so many good things. I love the music in it, it's wonderful. Only the music in the end by the... *don't know this word in english... when there stand what role everyone played and who wrote it etc.* that music I don't like that much.
The movie has great shots, and it's just great. There are great roles and the acting is very good.
I like Mad World because of this movie =)</p><hr><p><b>Mrs Gyllenhaal</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>i love this movie toooooo much!!! i love jake and the music especially...and the scene about smurfs!! too true.</p><hr><p><b>JS</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>
Fantastic off-the-wall indie flick, thought provoking, haunting, compassionate and occasionally beautiful. 

I'll be buggered if I know what it's about but I loved the imagery, the atmosphere and the spine-tingling score.  

The Tears for Fears soundtrack is absolutely cracking as well!

but its a very intresting film about a young guys troubled mind and how it helped him make a very important decision</p><hr><p><b>kristina</b> <a href="mailto:dinacow@hotmail.com" title="E-mail User"><img src="/images/emailuser.gif" border=0></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>poooooop i love this movie</p><hr><p><b>DreRok</b> <a href="mailto:DreRok@gmail.com" title="E-mail User"><img src="/images/emailuser.gif" border=0></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Great Movie!!!</p><hr><p><b>paul croke</b> <a href="mailto:paulcroke03@yahoo.co.uk" title="E-mail User"><img src="/images/emailuser.gif" border=0></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br> i reckon there are different levels of intepretation and it just depends on the viewer.. and for some reason DD has specifically captivated the mind of those individuals who are in a constant search for a deeper significance in things.. and it is because it has the capability of having such a profound meaning.. (most other movies have one or two interpreations and have a tendency of being superficial, yet donnie darko can be interpretaded through many distinct perspectives and seems not to have a definite concrete significance) 
</p><hr><p><b>J</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie is simply great.</p><hr><p><b>iphy</b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>I've just watched the film and really didn't understand why people exaggerated it so much. OK, it might be marvellous for teenagers, but there is a campaign like this is a gorgeous film for all. That’s why my expectations was so high and at the end i was totally dissapointed. I can say that jake & the script was fine, but it couldn’t take place in the list of my best films. </p><hr><p><b>Suz</b> <a href="mailto:kunlong@optonline.net" title="E-mail User"><img src="/images/emailuser.gif" border=0></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I've seen this movie SO MANY times, and with each viewing I feel more compelled to view it the next time- Each time grasping the depth of the concept of the movie on an even deeper more complex level. This movie is BY FAR for the psychologically elite-The depth of meaning of this movie goes FAR beyond one's surface of thought and feeling-With each experience delving deeper into one's inner most realm of thought and emotion. If able, one is SURE to fall in love and relate to the SIZE of PAIN and STRENGTH harboring within the character Donnie Darko, as did I. </p><hr><p><b>Greyson Futrell</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>A must see for the 2000's. A compelling story of complexity and psychologically made sweet! With deep depth and emotion reaching further into one's inner self. Though the movie can sometimes stray along, it lacks one great purpose, a solid significance.</p><hr><p><b>Don Amiche</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>OMG, no! Donnie Darko was made in 1988 and was set in 1988! It only says 2001 because that's the year the Directors cut was made. Look at Patrick Swayze! He's young! Look at Jake Gylennial! He's young too! Anyway, I saw the original version on tape when I was 12, and then I saw the directors cut. The directors cut is clearer than the original. But please, don't make that mistake again, mmk?</p><hr><p><b>you retard</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>Don't be so stupid, does it LOOK like a film that was shot in 1988? NO! It's just set in 1988 that's all.</p><hr><p><b>Hleb</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Brilliant film.

However why is the script missing the part where we hear Donnie reading the letter he sent Roberta Sparrow?

'Dear Roberta Sparrow, I have reached the end of your book and... there are so many things that I need to ask you. Sometimes I'm afraid of what you might tell me. Sometimes I'm afraid that you'll tell me that this is not a work of fiction. I can only hope that the answers will come to me in my sleep. I hope that when the world comes to an end, I can breathe a sigh of relief, because there will be so much to look forward to. '


</p><hr><p><b>chris</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>You do realise Don Amiche, that Jake Gyllenhall was 8 years old in 1988.</p><hr><p><b>Thomas</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Great script and great movie!</p><hr><p><b>Jenn</b> <a href="mailto:cheer_chic171@mchsi.com" title="E-mail User"><img src="/images/emailuser.gif" border=0></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This has been my favorite movie since I first saw it and I didn't know why until I began studying existentialism and realized it as a deep theme throughout this movie. It's amazing, how much has been woven in to sit just below the consciousness of the viewer.</p><hr><p><b>Isaac</b> <a href="mailto:isaacoleary@yahoo.com.au" title="E-mail User"><img src="/images/emailuser.gif" border=0></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>I love this film and since I've become a film student I have found even greater qualities in this movie. Personally I enjoy the original release of this film much more than the director's cut and a lot agree with me. Apparently, they've stopp ed making the original vision on DVD and it has become quite a collectors edition. Jake Gyllenhall was brilliant in this film, but surprisingly I thought Drew Barrymore didn't suit her role even though she was a producer. A great watch for teenagers - early adults, I don't think this movie would be THAT impressive to an older audience. But still, I'm 21 and it'd be in my top 20.</p><hr><p><b>voiceof1</b> <a href="mailto:dijackson89@hotmail.com" title="E-mail User"><img src="/images/emailuser.gif" border=0></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>This is one of the most haunting but intriguing movies I have ever seen. I liked it. Tears for Fears music adaptation is awesome.</p><hr><p><b>zarathustra</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>A GREAT movie. Proves Hollywood's cliche scripts are as inferior as their movies portray them e.g. Spielberg and Lucas = special effects + lots of cash =no talent. But I guess that's the movie industry today. Thank god there are exceptions to the rule.</p><hr><p><b>Aaron Whisman</b> <a href="mailto:aaronwhisman@hotmail.com" title="E-mail User"><img src="/images/emailuser.gif" border=0></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>For those of you who haven't seen this piece of brilliance, just die. This movie rules and I have watched it every night for the past 7 months. And it gets better every time I see it. And to that Don Amiche guy up there, this movie was not made in 1988. It was just based in it. My God, what is wrong with people? And you do realize that the Director's Cut is made the same time the movie is, it's just what he would have left in. Wow, just wow.</p><hr><p><b>mmmmm</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>One of my favourite movies for sure. There is probably such a positive response on this site because why would someone who hated the movie go on a Donnie Darko site? And as for the 1988 thing, I THINK the director people just had the concept of the film in their mind since then, but actually produced the film much later. Either way, excellent movie. </p><hr><p><b>The Great Cornholio!</b> <a href="mailto:billiejoe_mike_tre@hotmail.co.uk" title="E-mail User"><img src="/images/emailuser.gif" border=0></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie rocks. I love the fact that it's about a disturbed guy. I like movies like that. The music was great. The smurf scene and the scene where he almost masturbates are great because they're like in real life. I can imagine having the same smurf conversation. And someone said in another comment that "fight club" and "clockwork orange" are good films, I agree I highly recommend them. Fight Club is very psychological just like this movie. And clockwork orange is not for the light hearted or screemish but great movie!</p><hr><p><b>Whee</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie is so cool. I can't explain it, it just is. But the plot is really hard to get, you have to watch it like a bazillion times before it sinks in at all. Not to mention do some serious studying on the concept of time travel. But all in all this movie is so kick-ass it's unexplainable.</p><hr><p><b>David</b> <a href="mailto:donniedarko28_6_42_12@yahoo.com" title="E-mail User"><img src="/images/emailuser.gif" border=0></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Donnie Darko is the most original and thought-provoking film I've ever seen. Jake Gyllenhaal is an amazing actor. It's my favorite film of all time.</p><hr><p><b>nana</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>Mind-blowing. Gave me a lot of thinking-material, and that's something I really look for when getting contact with artwork. An 8 just because I did not figure some things out yet. But I will soon, and once I do, it'll certainly be a 10.</p><hr><p><b>joseph</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I really liked the model of the plane that crashed into Donnie's house, I thought it was very appropriate. I felt that this plane was indeed chosen to crash into their house. I also am very angered that it said 1988. The length of Elizabeth's hair was very well cut and I liked the soft texture of the rug in Donnie's room.</p><hr><p><b>Lou</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>FANTASTIC, AMAZING FILM! This movie is great. I love the rabbit! I like the characters and it is also funny. It can be confusing if you watch it the 1st time. It is sad and it makes you think. The music is good.</p><hr><p><b>Anthony</b> <a href="mailto:agstone1@msn.com" title="E-mail User"><img src="/images/emailuser.gif" border=0></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I LOVED THIS MOVIE! I am a psychology major and this movie, I am not sure why, has a weird meaning to me, that I can't explain. I don't know what psychology major has to do with this, but I never really "got it" before I got into college. Anyway, this is a really good movie especially the whole scene outside of grandma deads house (with gretchen and the car), the WHOLE part. Great movie.</p><hr><p><b>me</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love this movie, even though I don't exactly understand it.</p><hr><p><b>Chandler</b> <a href="mailto:cpj@austin.rr.com" title="E-mail User"><img src="/images/emailuser.gif" border=0></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This film was set in 1988, because that is when Richard Kelly, the writer/director of the film was a teenager, and that is the time when he knew what teenagers were like, as opposed to now. Furthermore, this film is a deeply disturbing psychological study of a fall into destruction. At the same time, however, the irony that destruction is a form of creation is always present. A stunning film in every way imaginable.</p><hr><p><b>Sandy</b> <a href="mailto:sandra.aldred@allport.co.uk" title="E-mail User"><img src="/images/emailuser.gif" border=0></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I absolutely loved this film and have seen it now approximately 4 times.  I can honestly say that I never get bored of it because it's so enthralling and so well acted that it completely sucks you in from the very beginning.  I have my own concept of the message the film is trying to put accross, as I'm sure many other do too, but one thing's for certain and that is that you need to see it more than once to have your own understanding.  Jake Gyllenhaal is excellent in this role of a 'deeply troubled teen' - I say this in inverted commas because I actually don't think that he was troubled - merely too intelligent for the world he was forced to participate in, evident in his unwillingness to 'place an x on the time-life line'.  Brilliant and thought provoking - just the right recipe for a an all time great movie.</p><hr><p><b>brooke</b> <a href="mailto:skibrookie91@yahoo.com" title="E-mail User"><img src="/images/emailuser.gif" border=0></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Oh my gosh.

It was well written and brilliantly acted. Every once in a while a film comes along and just catches you by the throat and makes you want to go out and write something yourself, this is one of these films. Had to laugh at the guy who actually thought this was made in 1988, he seemed so sure of himself.</p><hr><p><b>laila</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>I can't believe  how retarded some people are!

'OMG, no! Donnie Darko was made in 1988 and was set in 1988! It only says 2001 because that's the year the Directors cut was made. Look at Patrick Swayze! He's young! Look at Jake Gylennial! He's young too! Anyway, I saw the original version on tape when I was 12, and then I saw the directors cut. The directors cut is clearer than the original. But please, don't make that mistake again, mmk?'

Yes when jake gyllenhaal was 8 years old! Yeh he looked 8 in it right enough! and drew barrymore playing a teacher in it.. when she was 13! Seriously what an idiot. Everyone makes mistakes but to say 'dont make that mistake again, mmk? when he's the one making the mistake?!? ha! a cocky retard! </p><hr><p><b>hmmmm</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>I'd say the movie was an interesting watch, but it definitely lacks the depth that most see in it. It was entertaining, intriguing, well thought-out, had good acting (except for the 'bad' teenagers), and had a good script. But I wouldn't say it's worth the hype or the awesome praise a lot of people give it. I think everyone just gets wowed when the ending pulls everything together, in an odd way that wasn't expected. I give the makers props for making such a good, realistic movie out of a time-travel/ schizophrenia premise, two things that flirt with fantasy and science fiction. DD doesn't strike any important chords in me though, especially since 1, he ends up not being psychotic, and 2, the timetravel explanation just doesn't back up any kind of messages that could have shown through from other parts in the movie. I get that he and some other main characters are 'misfits' struggling with teenage issues, but even that theme didn't come through on its full potential. I would recommend this movie to everyone, but try not to over-praise this movie.</p><hr><p><b>Don Amiche FAIL</b> <a href="mailto:gardnerish@hotmail.com" title="E-mail User"><img src="/images/emailuser.gif" border=0></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>@Don Amiche It was shot in 2001, as everyone knows. If it was made in 1988 as you say, Richard Kelly would have only been 13. How many 13 year olds do you know who could write and direct a film like that? Retard.</p><hr><p><b>Jason</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>I'm just curious how someone could think a movie was made 13 years before the script was written or that they rewrite a script for a director's cut DVD. The only instance of that nature I can think of is Casablanca and that was filmed as it was written.</p><hr><p><b>Hunter</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie was great. Granted I had to watch it a few times before I understood the ending. Otherwise the movie was interesting and kept me watching. It's a great movie to watch when you want to be freaked out. The name Donnie Darko is now the come-back of choice and is especially funny when someone hasn't seen the movie.</p><hr><p><b>Szonja</b> <a href="mailto:so-szoni@gmail.hu" title="E-mail User"><img src="/images/emailuser.gif" border=0></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>A very original movie, an unusual teen film not only for teens. Great actors' performance, I must highlight Jake's acting skills. There are many layers in it and the music is fantastic. I liked those 80s songs.</p><hr><p><b>CrunkJuice</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I really do love this movie, it is even on my rather long list of "Favorite Movies". Recently I introduced it to a friend of mine, and afterwards we debated time travel for over an hour.

I must say that I really appreciate Jake Gyllenhaal as an actor. He's got something special when he's acting, something real and human that most of the actor don't have. He looks real.

The music perfectly captured the eerie essence of the film which is why, I feel, that people enjoy the original theatrical release over the director's cut. It's a popular film because haven't we all felt like outcasts at one time or another? Or if one is socially accepted, wouldn't that person hate themselves for being a member of such pretentiousness?</p><hr><p><b>Caleb</b> <a href="mailto:calebdlenz@hotmail.com" title="E-mail User"><img src="/images/emailuser.gif" border=0></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>For anyone who cares, my reading of the film (I've been pondering it for several years) is this: Everyone who let's go of their ancestors and gets alone, alone with the Bible will come to see that it is not the word of God (that's what "every living creature on earth dies alone" means). Richard Kelly is saying, Remember back in 1988 when Christians (people who wear "bunny suits"--meaning Jesus suits) were telling us that the world was about to end? It didn't. So obviously they were not looking at "God's channel"--the way God sees things. Donnie represents someone who thinks for himself (as it were), sees that the Bible teaches Jesus to be coming soon, and realizes that people will always be disappointed with that expectation, and decides to let go of his belief in the Bible. (Death in the film is religious death.) The spiral on the jet engine is a reference to Dark City (a film about people using the Bible to control us) and says that "seeing the failed expectations of the second coming" is a way out of the control that is religion. Donnie looks into the future, sees that the world is not going to end, and religiously dies in the present. Much more could be said. In terms of contemporary film, the most important thing to grasp from Donnie Darko is the idea that people who get alone, alone with the Bible lose their faith. Many movies symbolically interact with that idea. Donnie Darko should be seen alongside Fran Walsh et al's "The Lord of the Rings", which was crafted to bring out (for those who have ears to hear) the idea that the Bible is a ring of power which needs to be destroyed. Ehren Kruger's "The Ring" puts these two films together (I suspect Fran Walsh, Richard Kelly, and Ehren Kruger conspired together in making these particular films) and says that the last thing you see before you religiously die while studying the Bible is the fact that it is intrinsically a weapon for controlling people. (Good, bad, right, or wrong. Don't ever let your personal beliefs get in the way of your exposition of literature.).</p><hr><p><b>Sonni</b> <a href="mailto:sonyasalih_son@hotmail.co.uk" title="E-mail User"><img src="/images/emailuser.gif" border=0></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I've always loved this movie!
