1
00:01:25,853 --> 00:01:32,008
<i>In Washington, high-ranking Navy and
Army officers meet in closed conference.</i>

2
00:01:35,733 --> 00:01:38,293
<i>After months of secret preparations...</i>

3
00:01:38,453 --> 00:01:43,208
<i>... a far-reaching, combined operation
is about to begin.</i>

4
00:01:49,413 --> 00:01:51,290
<i>Continued secrecy is imperative...</i>

5
00:01:52,893 --> 00:01:55,168
<i>... for the plan 's success.</i>

6
00:03:32,133 --> 00:03:34,727
We've cornered the chili sauce market
for you, sir.

7
00:03:34,893 --> 00:03:37,168
Good work, Cookie.
Got steaks to go with it?

8
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:39,210
Yes, sir.

9
00:03:39,453 --> 00:03:41,284
Captain, last torpedo's on board.

10
00:03:41,453 --> 00:03:44,251
- Right. I'll be at the dock phone.
- Aye, aye, sir.

11
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:58,564
Any luck on that Oklahoma City call?

12
00:03:58,973 --> 00:04:02,170
Sorry, Captain Cassidy, I haven't
gotten through to your wife.

13
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:04,324
<i>You know how it is. Christmas Eve.</i>

14
00:04:04,493 --> 00:04:07,963
Yes, I know how it is.

15
00:04:08,253 --> 00:04:11,290
Thank you. Cancel the call.

16
00:04:26,893 --> 00:04:29,123
Hi, Rocky. That kid of yours
been born yet?

17
00:04:29,293 --> 00:04:33,081
- Yes, sir. It's a boy.
- What, no cigar?

18
00:04:33,253 --> 00:04:36,962
- Congratulations, Rocky.
- Thank you, sir.

19
00:04:42,093 --> 00:04:43,492
- Captain.
- What, Sparks?

20
00:04:43,653 --> 00:04:47,248
- I got the record changer all hooked up.
- So I hear.

21
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:50,092
The crew certainly does appreciate
your gift, sir.

22
00:04:50,253 --> 00:04:54,485
Well, after five patrols,
I appreciate my crew, Sparks.

23
00:05:12,653 --> 00:05:15,167
Full fuel, lube, oil, battery
and fresh water.

24
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:17,483
Engineering department
ready for sea, sir.

25
00:05:17,653 --> 00:05:20,486
Request permission to warm up
the main engine.

26
00:05:20,853 --> 00:05:23,492
- Okay, Larry.
- Thank you, sir.

27
00:05:23,653 --> 00:05:28,204
<i>Sweetheart, we're shoving off
ahead of schedule.</i>

28
00:05:28,373 --> 00:05:30,568
<i>Something urgent.</i>

29
00:05:30,733 --> 00:05:33,452
<i>I tried to telephone you
and the children...</i>

30
00:05:33,613 --> 00:05:35,763
<i>... to wish you a merry Christmas...</i>

31
00:05:35,933 --> 00:05:40,723
<i>... and to tell you I'm now wearing
three stripes on my sleeve...</i>

32
00:05:42,093 --> 00:05:46,405
<i>... and some embarrassingly shiny
scrambled eggs on my cap.</i>

33
00:05:46,573 --> 00:05:49,610
<i>I hope you like
the nylon stockings, darling.</i>

34
00:05:49,773 --> 00:05:52,492
<i>Don 't ask me how I got them.</i>

35
00:05:53,413 --> 00:05:57,372
<i>Tell Michael I couldn 't find
a toy submarine.</i>

36
00:05:57,973 --> 00:06:01,045
<i>Tell him it's the war.
He'll understand.</i>

37
00:06:01,213 --> 00:06:04,922
<i>There's even a shortage of teddy bears,
but I found one for Debby.</i>

38
00:06:05,853 --> 00:06:10,722
<i>I hope her chickenpox didn 't leave
any marks on that sweet face.</i>

39
00:06:12,813 --> 00:06:16,408
Full torpedoes onboard.
All tubes loaded and ready for war shot.

40
00:06:16,573 --> 00:06:19,007
Full ammunition and pyrotechnics
onboard.

41
00:06:19,173 --> 00:06:22,131
- Gunnery department ready for sea, sir.
- Very well, Pete.

42
00:06:22,293 --> 00:06:24,966
- Send in the mail orderly, please.
- Aye, aye, sir.

43
00:06:25,493 --> 00:06:30,692
<i>I've got the same good crew.
A few new men from sub school.</i>

44
00:06:30,853 --> 00:06:32,923
<i>If we were together tonight, darling...</i>

45
00:06:38,573 --> 00:06:41,451
- Mail orderly, captain.
- Mail this before we shove off.

46
00:06:41,613 --> 00:06:43,524
Aye, aye, sir.

47
00:06:44,093 --> 00:06:46,561
All hands aboard. All departments
ready for sea.

48
00:06:46,733 --> 00:06:48,564
Secured quarters.

49
00:06:52,493 --> 00:06:54,006
They won't kick you upstairs.

50
00:06:54,173 --> 00:06:56,892
- You're too valuable at sea.
- Who's kidding who?

51
00:06:57,053 --> 00:06:59,772
I'll be fighting from a desk
after this patrol, Andy.

52
00:07:02,933 --> 00:07:05,003
Gather around, men.

53
00:07:09,573 --> 00:07:11,529
I'm sorry your liberty was cut short.

54
00:07:11,693 --> 00:07:16,642
The Navy would've let us have Christmas
ashore if this wasn't important.

55
00:07:16,813 --> 00:07:20,123
The men who've been with me know
I don't believe in fight talks.

56
00:07:20,293 --> 00:07:23,205
When a man gives a fight talk,
he needs one himself.

57
00:07:23,373 --> 00:07:26,809
For the benefit of newcomers,
you're here because you volunteered.

58
00:07:26,973 --> 00:07:30,966
You're well-trained, highly selected men,
and we're glad to have you aboard.

59
00:07:31,133 --> 00:07:33,522
You may be infants in
the submarine service...

60
00:07:33,693 --> 00:07:36,685
...but you'll be veterans
by the time we make port again.

61
00:07:36,853 --> 00:07:38,605
We've had pretty fair luck so far.

62
00:07:38,773 --> 00:07:41,606
Let's hope we really smear them
this time.

63
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:44,892
- Dismiss the crew.
- Aye, aye, sir.

64
00:07:45,133 --> 00:07:46,691
Leave your quarters.

65
00:07:51,693 --> 00:07:56,403
Shore connection is clear. Topside
secured, all except mooring lines.

66
00:07:56,973 --> 00:07:58,804
Okay, chief.

67
00:07:59,533 --> 00:08:02,605
All tested out. Ship ready
for getting under way, sir.

68
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:05,162
Number one and two
main engines on propulsion.

69
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:07,767
Okay, let's go.

70
00:08:07,933 --> 00:08:09,685
Single up!

71
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:14,244
Answer bells.

72
00:08:14,413 --> 00:08:16,324
Take in one!

73
00:08:17,053 --> 00:08:19,328
Pull five! Port, back one-third.

74
00:08:22,413 --> 00:08:24,643
Port, stop.

75
00:08:24,813 --> 00:08:27,168
Take in five!

76
00:08:28,413 --> 00:08:30,688
All ahead one-third.

77
00:08:50,573 --> 00:08:54,885
- Hatch secured.
- Report, forward room rigged for diving.

78
00:08:56,373 --> 00:08:59,092
What do you think you are?
The pipes of Pan?

79
00:08:59,253 --> 00:09:01,289
This, Dakota, is a genuine Nazi flute.

80
00:09:01,453 --> 00:09:04,331
- I paid an Atlantic sailor 5 bucks for it.
- Nazi flute?

81
00:09:04,493 --> 00:09:06,643
You can get them in Frisco for four bits.

82
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:09,607
- You know of Tarpon Springs, Florida?
- Sure.

83
00:09:09,773 --> 00:09:11,047
- You do?
- Yeah.

84
00:09:11,213 --> 00:09:14,250
The best fishermen in the world
are the Greeks, my people.

85
00:09:14,413 --> 00:09:15,687
You're Greek?

86
00:09:15,853 --> 00:09:17,650
- Greek-American.
- What's your name?

87
00:09:17,813 --> 00:09:21,089
Leos Deopoulis Gurfelis Junior.
That "junior" is pure American.

88
00:09:21,253 --> 00:09:25,087
But seeing you're off a destroyer
we'll settle for "Tin Can." Okay?

89
00:09:25,253 --> 00:09:29,007
Okay, just so long as nobody
around here calls me "Hey, Greek."

90
00:09:29,173 --> 00:09:31,323
- I'm sensitive.
- Oh, Mike.

91
00:09:32,293 --> 00:09:34,204
Surprise.

92
00:09:36,453 --> 00:09:38,125
Here's that 5-spot I borrowed.

93
00:09:38,293 --> 00:09:42,525
- Fine time to pay me back.
- But I did pay you.

94
00:09:43,373 --> 00:09:47,412
There goes one of the nicest guys
that ever borrowed 5 bucks from me.

95
00:09:48,013 --> 00:09:50,402
Why doesn't the captain
wear his decorations?

96
00:09:50,573 --> 00:09:53,610
- Doesn't need to.
- We heard a lot about him at sub school.

97
00:09:53,773 --> 00:09:55,843
You can believe anything that was good.

98
00:09:56,013 --> 00:10:00,086
Those torpedoes cost 12,000 bucks
apiece. Our skipper doesn't waste them.

99
00:10:00,253 --> 00:10:03,848
He's got more plain intestinal fortitude
than any guy I ever met.

100
00:10:04,013 --> 00:10:06,402
I'd follow him right into
the mikado's bathtub.

101
00:10:06,573 --> 00:10:08,245
Do you think we'll see action?

102
00:10:08,413 --> 00:10:10,722
Good. That's why I got off
that four-stacker.

103
00:10:10,893 --> 00:10:13,646
Up and down, nothing but escorting.
Made me sick.

104
00:10:13,813 --> 00:10:16,373
- Sitting on a beehive?
- I know. He wants a medal.

105
00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:19,047
Who cares about medals?
I got a better reason.

106
00:10:19,213 --> 00:10:21,602
Pipe down. Look.

107
00:10:21,773 --> 00:10:26,801
In all my 12 years in the Navy,
I never seen a doll on a submarine.

108
00:10:28,893 --> 00:10:31,851
I won her, Mike. Cute, huh?

109
00:10:32,573 --> 00:10:34,962
- She gonna bunk with you?
- Yep.

110
00:10:35,133 --> 00:10:37,363
She's a liberty gimmick.
Makes gals jealous.

111
00:10:37,533 --> 00:10:39,012
- Jealous of that doll?
- Sure.

112
00:10:39,173 --> 00:10:41,482
I take her into a joint, sit her on a table.

113
00:10:41,653 --> 00:10:44,121
Then we have a long talk.
It never fails.

114
00:10:44,293 --> 00:10:47,046
Dame comes up and says,
"That's the best you can do?"

115
00:10:47,213 --> 00:10:49,090
I says, "That's up to you, honey."

116
00:10:50,013 --> 00:10:52,004
What happens then?

117
00:10:52,173 --> 00:10:54,607
- How old are you, Tommy?
- Nineteen.

118
00:10:54,773 --> 00:10:56,764
Come back next year.

119
00:10:57,773 --> 00:11:00,890
Say, that's a cute military objective
you got there.

120
00:11:01,413 --> 00:11:05,292
- That's my sister.
- Oh, intelligent too.

121
00:11:05,693 --> 00:11:10,244
Well, if you boys don't mind, Nita and I,
we want to be alone, don't we?

122
00:11:10,413 --> 00:11:14,884
See? It's cute. I told you.
You know, it works all the time.

123
00:11:25,013 --> 00:11:27,925
Passed the submarine net, captain.

124
00:11:29,693 --> 00:11:33,845
Well, Andy, it'll be a long time
between beers.

125
00:11:58,013 --> 00:12:00,481
Merry Christmas, Mike.

126
00:12:04,573 --> 00:12:07,167
Merry Christmas, Tommy.

127
00:12:11,533 --> 00:12:14,491
This is the first Christmas
I ever spent underwater.

128
00:12:14,653 --> 00:12:18,009
You should have been aboard with us
Christmas Day 1941.

129
00:12:18,173 --> 00:12:20,641
The Japs sure gave us
a Christmas present.

130
00:12:20,813 --> 00:12:24,362
Blasted the living daylights out of us
off Lingayen Gulf.

131
00:12:24,533 --> 00:12:27,843
Between depth charges,
we ate Christmas dinner in the dark...

132
00:12:28,013 --> 00:12:31,403
...200 feet down.
Ice water and sandwiches.

133
00:12:31,573 --> 00:12:37,762
Well-sprinkled with rust and chips of
paint that kept flying off the bulkheads.

134
00:12:37,933 --> 00:12:44,042
- Bet you said your prayers.
- I sure did. Some extra Hail Marys too.

135
00:12:44,213 --> 00:12:47,364
- You think prayers do any good, Mike?
- Sure, they do.

136
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:50,366
Some guys say, "Go ahead, prove to me
there's a God."

137
00:12:50,533 --> 00:12:55,243
I don't argue. I just know,
like I know there's salt in the sea.

138
00:12:55,413 --> 00:12:57,290
That's the way it is with me too.

139
00:12:57,453 --> 00:13:02,049
Look, Mike, if we get depth-charged,
and I show any signs of being yellow...

140
00:13:02,213 --> 00:13:04,568
...you sock me.
- Right on the button.

141
00:13:04,733 --> 00:13:08,282
- That's a promise?
- It's a promise.

142
00:13:08,453 --> 00:13:11,047
If I were in Connecticut now...

143
00:13:11,213 --> 00:13:14,728
...Mother and Dad would come in
to wake me singing Christmas carols.

144
00:13:14,893 --> 00:13:17,726
It's sort of a custom they started
when I was a kid.

145
00:13:24,413 --> 00:13:27,291
Pretty, ain't it?
Those guys practice all year for this.

146
00:13:27,453 --> 00:13:29,808
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas, you guys!

147
00:13:29,973 --> 00:13:31,964
- Merry Christmas, Tin Can!
- Happy Noel.

148
00:13:32,133 --> 00:13:33,566
Same to you and many more.

149
00:13:42,253 --> 00:13:44,164
Merry Christmas, skipper.

150
00:13:44,493 --> 00:13:46,529
Merry Christmas, fellas.

151
00:13:46,693 --> 00:13:48,570
Merry Christmas, skipper.

152
00:14:21,453 --> 00:14:23,842
And a very merry Christmas
to you gents.

153
00:14:24,013 --> 00:14:26,766
We'll have to top the diesels.

154
00:15:01,773 --> 00:15:04,571
Hey, get a load of him, will you?

155
00:15:08,493 --> 00:15:10,165
Presents.

156
00:15:13,653 --> 00:15:16,451
"For Pills, the pharmacist's mate,
a mournful knell.

157
00:15:16,613 --> 00:15:20,083
He dropped his vitamins
down the periscope well."

158
00:15:20,373 --> 00:15:22,091
So, what do you got?

159
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:25,488
"The new kid forward
is wiser but sadder.

160
00:15:25,653 --> 00:15:28,804
Since he stepped on the skipper
coming down the ladder!"

161
00:15:28,973 --> 00:15:31,203
I apologized.

162
00:15:32,013 --> 00:15:34,208
"On Wolf's grave, a wreath is laid.

163
00:15:34,373 --> 00:15:38,207
Since he tangled his line
with that chambermaid."

164
00:15:38,373 --> 00:15:39,806
- Come on, open it.
- Open it!

165
00:15:49,493 --> 00:15:51,529
You should have had it filled.

166
00:15:52,653 --> 00:15:54,883
"All hands get ready
to upchuck this dinner.

167
00:15:55,053 --> 00:15:58,409
With Cookie in the galley,
we're going to get thinner."

168
00:16:00,813 --> 00:16:02,246
Fine, listen.

169
00:16:02,413 --> 00:16:06,406
If that ain't a new high
for gratitude.

170
00:16:06,573 --> 00:16:09,724
Who practically mothers
all the guys on this ship?

171
00:16:09,893 --> 00:16:11,372
I do.

172
00:16:11,533 --> 00:16:14,809
Who bends over a hot stove
all day long for you guys?

173
00:16:14,973 --> 00:16:16,247
I do.

174
00:16:16,653 --> 00:16:19,690
Who's going to get all the glory
when you sink a Jap ship?

175
00:16:19,853 --> 00:16:21,571
You! That's who.

176
00:16:21,733 --> 00:16:24,372
Who's gonna get the medals
from this war? You guys!

177
00:16:24,533 --> 00:16:29,926
And what am I going to get? Nothing but
varicose veins and dishwater hands!

178
00:16:30,213 --> 00:16:32,169
Open it! Open it!

179
00:16:32,893 --> 00:16:34,849
What have you got? Open it.

180
00:16:49,813 --> 00:16:51,724
Gee, guys.

181
00:16:52,373 --> 00:16:55,126
You shouldn't have done it.

182
00:16:58,013 --> 00:17:00,163
Lookouts to the bridge.

183
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:01,766
Keep your eyes peeled, kid.

184
00:17:01,933 --> 00:17:04,766
All submarines look alike.
We're nobody's friend.

185
00:17:04,933 --> 00:17:08,812
Even our ships will shoot first
and ask questions afterward.

186
00:17:09,773 --> 00:17:12,003
He listens to you like you were
a tin god.

187
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:28,969
- Look pretty snappy today, captain.
- You know, Christmas.

188
00:17:36,413 --> 00:17:39,564
- Coffee, sir.
- Thank you.

189
00:17:40,773 --> 00:17:43,924
- All clear starboard.
- All clear port.

190
00:17:44,733 --> 00:17:47,042
You fellas know me.
I'm no highbrow.

191
00:17:47,213 --> 00:17:50,091
When I come home, if there's
any grand opera playing...

192
00:17:50,253 --> 00:17:53,802
...the whole Connors family goes
down there twice a week.

193
00:17:53,973 --> 00:17:57,283
Don't ask me why, but to me, it's like
going down in a sub.

194
00:17:57,453 --> 00:18:00,490
You shove off,
go deep under the sea.

195
00:18:00,653 --> 00:18:01,927
When you come back up...

196
00:18:02,093 --> 00:18:05,165
...you got something inside
that's never been there before.

197
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:07,244
Irish and Greeks, born philosophers.

198
00:18:07,453 --> 00:18:08,772
I got a philosophy too.

199
00:18:08,933 --> 00:18:12,209
Every day a box of Cracker Jacks
with a prize in every package.

200
00:18:12,373 --> 00:18:15,206
I feel sorry for you.
You don't know what family means.

201
00:18:15,373 --> 00:18:18,570
Family means a house has a mortgage,
the kids have measles...

202
00:18:18,733 --> 00:18:22,726
...and the old man pays for the insurance
when he's dead. No, not for Wolfie.

203
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:25,612
The only babies I want
are those born 21 years ago.

204
00:18:25,773 --> 00:18:29,288
<i>Captain has given permission to pick up
the San Francisco newscast.</i>

205
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:32,964
<i>This broadcast comes to you
from the Friendly Credit Company.</i>

206
00:18:33,133 --> 00:18:38,253
<i>The Friendly Credit Company trusts you.
Any amount from $ 25 to $ 1000.</i>

207
00:18:38,533 --> 00:18:42,321
<i>And so Christmas Day
is bright on all fronts.</i>

208
00:18:42,493 --> 00:18:45,929
<i>San Francisco police are continuing
the manhunt for a sailor...</i>

209
00:18:46,093 --> 00:18:47,970
<i>... wanted on several counts.</i>

210
00:18:48,213 --> 00:18:51,091
<i>The woman making the complaints
insists on prosecution.</i>

211
00:18:51,253 --> 00:18:55,371
<i>The sailor was last seen boarding a
United States submarine at Mare Island.</i>

212
00:18:55,533 --> 00:18:59,845
<i>The sailor is known to the girls
only as "Wolf."</i>

213
00:19:00,533 --> 00:19:03,570
- Well, Wolfie!
- Shut up.

214
00:19:03,773 --> 00:19:07,004
However, his shipmates volunteered
information to the police.

215
00:19:07,173 --> 00:19:10,404
Enough to send him up for 1042 years.

216
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:15,124
The Wolf has been described as a body
of man entirely surrounded by women.

217
00:19:15,293 --> 00:19:16,567
- He's...
- Terrific!

218
00:19:16,773 --> 00:19:18,172
Terrific.

219
00:19:21,373 --> 00:19:23,409
It's just a gag, Wolfie. Just a gag.

220
00:19:23,573 --> 00:19:26,451
Captain give you permission
to pull that stunt?

221
00:19:26,613 --> 00:19:29,923
- Yes, sir.
- I was in on the gag too.

222
00:19:30,093 --> 00:19:33,722
- Were you?
- Well, just around the edges.

223
00:19:40,173 --> 00:19:44,371
- Plane coming in at the sun!
- Clear the bridge! Take her down!

224
00:20:02,133 --> 00:20:04,203
- Hatch secured!
- Battle stations manned.

225
00:20:04,373 --> 00:20:06,170
Main induction closed.

226
00:20:20,613 --> 00:20:22,205
What was it?

227
00:20:22,373 --> 00:20:24,648
Looked like a four-motor
bomber to me.

228
00:20:24,893 --> 00:20:26,246
Pressure in the boat, sir.

229
00:20:36,813 --> 00:20:39,281
Level off at 150 feet.

230
00:20:39,693 --> 00:20:42,002
- Rig for depth charge.
- Rig for depth charge.

231
00:20:42,253 --> 00:20:44,642
Close main vents.

232
00:20:45,293 --> 00:20:46,646
Main vents closed, sir.

233
00:20:46,813 --> 00:20:49,646
- Blow negative.
- Blow negative.

234
00:20:50,213 --> 00:20:53,091
- Close negative flood.
- Close negative flood.

235
00:20:53,253 --> 00:20:54,732
Negative flood closed, sir.

236
00:20:54,973 --> 00:20:57,407
- Level off at 150.
- Level off at 150.

237
00:21:04,333 --> 00:21:06,642
- Zero bubble.
- Zero bubble.

238
00:21:11,813 --> 00:21:13,883
Open all vents.

239
00:21:18,093 --> 00:21:21,449
- All ahead one-third.
- All ahead one-third.

240
00:21:22,413 --> 00:21:24,404
All answering ahead one-third, sir.

241
00:21:24,573 --> 00:21:26,962
- Pump from auxiliary to sea.
- Auxiliary to sea!

242
00:21:28,773 --> 00:21:32,766
- Can we hear it when it comes?
- Yep, son.

243
00:21:32,933 --> 00:21:34,810
We'll hear it, all right.

244
00:21:36,573 --> 00:21:40,805
- Isn't there anything we can do?
- Yep. We're doing it.

245
00:21:43,853 --> 00:21:45,923
Maybe it's one of our own planes.

246
00:21:46,253 --> 00:21:48,813
If we sink, it doesn't matter
who drops the bombs.

247
00:22:09,093 --> 00:22:11,323
Think they can see
our shadow from the air?

248
00:22:11,493 --> 00:22:13,688
That's what we're finding out.

249
00:22:24,773 --> 00:22:26,843
All clear, sir.

250
00:22:27,253 --> 00:22:29,721
Let's go up for a look-see.
Periscope depth.

251
00:22:30,013 --> 00:22:32,447
Periscope depth. Five degrees up angle.

252
00:22:32,613 --> 00:22:35,810
- Twenty-degree rise on the bow planes.
- Five degrees up angle.

253
00:22:35,973 --> 00:22:39,010
- Twenty-degree rise, sir.
- Take charge of your planes.

254
00:22:50,733 --> 00:22:52,325
Up a foot.

255
00:23:00,973 --> 00:23:04,045
Maybe that plane had feathers.

256
00:23:04,213 --> 00:23:07,762
Looks as if we dunked
for a four-motored albatross.

257
00:23:07,933 --> 00:23:11,084
Service, down scope.
Have a merry Christmas, men.

258
00:23:11,253 --> 00:23:17,089
- Gee, fellas. I could have sworn...
- Albatross have retractable landing gear?

259
00:23:17,453 --> 00:23:19,921
Lookouts to the bridge!

260
00:23:20,093 --> 00:23:23,847
- You can hear that motor so plain!
- Key down. He feels bad enough.

261
00:23:44,493 --> 00:23:47,212
Watch out, or they'll give you
an E for imagination.

262
00:23:47,373 --> 00:23:49,250
Lay off him, Rocky.

263
00:23:49,413 --> 00:23:50,687
That's all right, son.

264
00:23:50,853 --> 00:23:54,528
I'd rather submerge for 100 birds
than not submerge for one plane.

265
00:23:54,693 --> 00:23:56,843
Thank you, sir.

266
00:24:09,373 --> 00:24:13,082
- All clear starboard.
- All clear port.

267
00:24:37,933 --> 00:24:39,844
Hello, Andy.

268
00:24:40,013 --> 00:24:43,130
Almost 24 hours out now, skipper.
About time to open orders?

269
00:24:43,333 --> 00:24:45,608
Three minutes to go, Andy.

270
00:24:45,773 --> 00:24:48,492
I got a hunch it's something big.

271
00:24:48,933 --> 00:24:51,527
Last night, I dreamed
we upped periscope.

272
00:24:51,693 --> 00:24:54,765
Right in the middle of
the entire Jap imperial fleet.

273
00:24:54,933 --> 00:24:56,764
Passing in review.

274
00:24:56,933 --> 00:25:00,243
- Did we sink them all?
- With one torpedo.

275
00:25:00,413 --> 00:25:01,687
Billiard shot.

276
00:25:01,853 --> 00:25:04,321
By the way, there's a man
from the forward room.

277
00:25:04,493 --> 00:25:07,769
Wants to see you on a matter
of vital importance.

278
00:25:08,293 --> 00:25:12,172
- Torpedoman Adams.
- Send him in.

279
00:25:18,213 --> 00:25:22,764
I was told I'd have to ask you, sir.

280
00:25:25,213 --> 00:25:26,885
Go ahead. Ask me.

281
00:25:27,053 --> 00:25:30,807
Sir, at sub school, we saw a lot
of pictures of submariners...

282
00:25:30,973 --> 00:25:34,488
...coming back from patrols with beards.

283
00:25:34,653 --> 00:25:38,168
- So you want to grow one?
- Yes, sir.

284
00:25:39,373 --> 00:25:43,082
- Think you can?
- Sir, I'd like to find out.

285
00:25:43,693 --> 00:25:46,002
Well, I'll tell you, Adams.

286
00:25:46,173 --> 00:25:49,483
First patrol, we all grew beards.
I had a pip.

287
00:25:49,653 --> 00:25:51,530
The second patrol was
half and half.

288
00:25:51,693 --> 00:25:55,368
Then we decided beards are itchy.
They get greasy. We keep a trim ship.

289
00:25:55,533 --> 00:25:57,763
Makes sense we have a trim crew
to man her.

290
00:25:57,933 --> 00:25:59,207
Yes, sir.

291
00:25:59,373 --> 00:26:02,570
But I don't want to cheat you
of a beard on your first patrol.

292
00:26:02,733 --> 00:26:06,009
Oh, that's all right, sir.
I only shave twice a week anyway.

293
00:26:06,173 --> 00:26:08,482
If I could grow one,
it'd look a little limp.

294
00:26:08,933 --> 00:26:12,130
I'll stick to shaving twice a week, sir.

295
00:26:12,293 --> 00:26:15,490
Maybe when we get back,
you'll be shaving three times a week.

296
00:26:16,253 --> 00:26:20,371
Thank you, sir. I guess I'd better
get back and do what I was doing.

297
00:26:20,533 --> 00:26:22,410
Thank you.

298
00:27:03,213 --> 00:27:05,602
Send the quartermaster
with the chart catalog.

299
00:27:05,973 --> 00:27:09,170
Captain wants the chart catalog, Rocky.

300
00:27:13,373 --> 00:27:15,933
- Chart catalog, sir.
- Thank you. Stand by.

301
00:27:17,213 --> 00:27:19,443
- Has he come yet?
- No. He's still in there.

302
00:27:20,333 --> 00:27:23,052
- Bring in chart 1291.
- Aye, aye, sir.

303
00:27:25,373 --> 00:27:30,083
Just get out that old chart of Tahiti.
I got a tomato in Papeete.

304
00:27:30,773 --> 00:27:32,604
Poetry.

305
00:27:46,613 --> 00:27:49,002
Gonna write a letter
to your wife every night?

306
00:27:49,173 --> 00:27:52,927
- Yep. Sort of keeps us in touch.
- Doesn't make sense if there's no mail.

307
00:27:53,093 --> 00:27:54,845
Who knows? We might hit Australia.

308
00:27:55,093 --> 00:27:57,368
Then again, we might not.

309
00:28:02,773 --> 00:28:04,923
Funny thing about submarines.

310
00:28:05,093 --> 00:28:08,449
The crew always knows where
we're going before the captain does.

311
00:28:23,253 --> 00:28:24,925
Holy smoke! Tokyo?

312
00:28:25,093 --> 00:28:27,653
I always wanted to see those geisha gals
up-close.

313
00:28:27,813 --> 00:28:29,883
Too bad you didn't study
"Japany" lingo.

314
00:28:30,053 --> 00:28:33,284
Listen, my kind of language
is international.

315
00:28:34,573 --> 00:28:37,531
How are we going to get
into Tokyo Bay?

316
00:28:37,693 --> 00:28:40,082
<i>The Copperfin just naturally
sprouts wings.</i>

317
00:28:40,253 --> 00:28:42,403
We fly over the nets
and the minefields...

318
00:28:42,573 --> 00:28:46,088
...plumb in the middle of the harbor.
- Tokyo Bay. Perfect.

319
00:28:46,253 --> 00:28:48,642
Bet we sink 70,000 tons.
20 bucks, even money.

320
00:28:48,813 --> 00:28:52,726
- Seventy thousand tons. You're nuts.
- Look, I got a reason to have luck.

321
00:28:52,893 --> 00:28:54,884
Where I go, there's gonna be
dead Japs.

322
00:28:55,053 --> 00:28:58,363
- What is this reason of yours?
- Never mind. Anybody wanna bet?

323
00:28:58,533 --> 00:29:01,605
It's a secret between him and Roosevelt.
I'll take the bet.

324
00:29:01,773 --> 00:29:03,684
I'll pay off double if we make it.

325
00:29:03,853 --> 00:29:07,129
Only two guys whistle in the Navy.
Boatswain's mates and boots.

326
00:29:07,293 --> 00:29:08,692
You a boatswain's mate?

327
00:29:08,853 --> 00:29:11,242
I'm sorry, Mike. I forgot.

328
00:29:11,413 --> 00:29:12,732
You hear that music?

329
00:29:12,893 --> 00:29:16,124
- Reminds me of a dame I knew in Frisco.
- Here we go again.

330
00:29:16,293 --> 00:29:19,126
She was built for speed,
like a destroyer.

331
00:29:19,333 --> 00:29:22,609
- Oh, now I listen.
- Kind of compact too, like a submarine.

332
00:29:22,773 --> 00:29:25,890
She was coming down Sutter Street.
Off my starboard beam.

333
00:29:26,053 --> 00:29:28,009
<i>I sees her and says, "Up periscope."</i>

334
00:29:28,173 --> 00:29:32,485
<i>I gives my motor a third back and
maneuvers for an opening shot.</i>

335
00:29:33,733 --> 00:29:35,689
<i>She picks me up on her detector.</i>

336
00:29:35,853 --> 00:29:39,448
<i>Gives her rudder a hard left.
Makes like she's looking in the window.</i>

337
00:29:39,773 --> 00:29:43,891
<i>Naturally, I gives my rudder
a hard right and moves...</i>

338
00:29:44,053 --> 00:29:48,126
<i>... right up alongside her. She's beautiful.
But beautiful!</i>

339
00:29:48,293 --> 00:29:50,568
<i>Comes up to about my chin.
Fits just right.</i>

340
00:29:50,733 --> 00:29:53,611
Well, neither of us breaks silence.

341
00:29:53,773 --> 00:29:57,766
Naturally, there's a long pause.
We're both running on batteries now.

342
00:29:57,933 --> 00:30:00,493
Something electric is going on between
her and me.

343
00:30:00,933 --> 00:30:02,889
I'd been on patrol three months.

344
00:30:03,053 --> 00:30:04,805
And this was
my first night ashore.

345
00:30:04,973 --> 00:30:06,884
Now, you guys know how it is.

346
00:30:07,093 --> 00:30:11,689
There she was in a nice, clean, crisp,
lacy blouse.

347
00:30:12,293 --> 00:30:15,171
And she looked
just like she had a bath.

348
00:30:15,333 --> 00:30:17,130
So she looked like she had a bath.

349
00:30:18,093 --> 00:30:19,845
She even smelled like geranium.

350
00:30:20,013 --> 00:30:22,891
So she even smelled like geraniums.
Then what?

351
00:30:23,053 --> 00:30:27,046
Here we are, hove to,
with her smelling like geraniums...

352
00:30:27,213 --> 00:30:29,602
...and me with three months' pay
in my whites.

353
00:30:29,933 --> 00:30:32,401
- I'll never forget it!
- Never forget what, Wolf?

354
00:30:32,573 --> 00:30:34,962
Some dames have lips that
are curved all right.

355
00:30:35,133 --> 00:30:39,126
But when you kiss them, you find they
have lips as hard as a warhead?

356
00:30:39,293 --> 00:30:44,321
Well, you could tell hers
was as soft as silk.

357
00:30:44,493 --> 00:30:48,645
Just enough lipstick. Just right.

358
00:30:48,813 --> 00:30:51,725
Well, what did you do about it?

359
00:30:51,893 --> 00:30:54,930
<i>I was so busy drinking her in
out of my starboard lamps...</i>

360
00:30:55,093 --> 00:30:59,450
<i>... that I don 't see this Market Street
commando hove to alongside her.</i>

361
00:30:59,613 --> 00:31:02,332
<i>I'm trying to get a recognition signal
out of her...</i>

362
00:31:02,493 --> 00:31:04,723
<i>... when this sailor busts right in
and says:</i>

363
00:31:04,893 --> 00:31:07,043
<i>"Would you like one
of those lacy things?"</i>

364
00:31:07,213 --> 00:31:09,647
<i>She says, "Sure."
And they go in and buy one.</i>

365
00:31:09,813 --> 00:31:12,452
<i>- Well, what did you do?
- Me? I'm murdered!</i>

366
00:31:13,093 --> 00:31:17,052
<i>There I am, anchored,
dead in the water...</i>

367
00:31:17,213 --> 00:31:19,852
<i>... looking in the window.
She's picking out one.</i>

368
00:31:20,013 --> 00:31:23,528
<i>And this Market Street commando
is giving me the gloat!</i>

369
00:31:23,693 --> 00:31:25,729
<i>Am I burnt. I'm dying!</i>

370
00:31:25,893 --> 00:31:28,851
My first night in. There she'd been,
standing next to me.

371
00:31:29,013 --> 00:31:31,846
- Smelling like geraniums.
- Okay, we been through that.

372
00:31:32,013 --> 00:31:35,164
This Market Street commando peels
off some lettuce and pays.

373
00:31:35,333 --> 00:31:38,052
And she's smiling
as sweet as a dream.

374
00:31:38,213 --> 00:31:42,491
And there I am, outside the window,
bulkheads busted in.

375
00:31:42,653 --> 00:31:44,962
<i>Next thing I know,
she gives this guy a kiss.</i>

376
00:31:45,133 --> 00:31:48,170
<i>And the next thing I know,
she's making for my anchorage...</i>

377
00:31:48,333 --> 00:31:51,325
<i>... with his stuff under her arm,
and she's saying to me:</i>

378
00:31:51,493 --> 00:31:53,211
<i>"Going my way, submariner?"</i>

379
00:31:53,373 --> 00:31:55,967
Then what happened, Wolf?

380
00:31:56,133 --> 00:31:58,966
She was built for speed,
but like I said, kid...

381
00:31:59,133 --> 00:32:03,285
...kind of compact too, like a submarine.

382
00:32:15,333 --> 00:32:19,406
According to the orders, we're to pick
up the lieutenant here at point x-ray.

383
00:32:19,573 --> 00:32:22,610
A PBY boat will meet us at 1430.

384
00:32:22,773 --> 00:32:24,286
Why are they flying him down?

385
00:32:24,453 --> 00:32:27,650
Save us going out of our way
to pick him up. Time's important.

386
00:32:28,253 --> 00:32:30,562
- Who is he?
- Aerology specialist.

387
00:32:30,733 --> 00:32:32,849
North Pacific area.

388
00:32:33,013 --> 00:32:35,368
All we have to do
is put him ashore in Japan.

389
00:32:40,613 --> 00:32:42,968
You are showing signs
of needing a sun lamp.

390
00:32:43,133 --> 00:32:45,693
From now on, sign up.
Everybody, once a day.

391
00:32:46,333 --> 00:32:49,211
- You ever want to be a real doctor, Pills?
- Yeah.

392
00:32:49,373 --> 00:32:52,729
I was one of those wise guys
who didn't know where he was going.

393
00:32:52,893 --> 00:32:54,963
Funny place to find out, on submarines.

394
00:32:55,653 --> 00:32:57,962
- What college did you go to?
- California.

395
00:32:58,133 --> 00:33:00,124
Only a year. Then I signed up.

396
00:33:00,293 --> 00:33:03,490
I had an A in chemistry,
so they made me a pharmacist's mate.

397
00:33:03,653 --> 00:33:05,962
Ain't it wonderful what
an education will do?

398
00:33:06,133 --> 00:33:09,409
When I got out of third grade,
I took a job at Coney Island.

399
00:33:09,573 --> 00:33:12,406
- Frying hot dogs.
- You should have stuck to hot dogs.

400
00:33:13,133 --> 00:33:14,725
Where's that half-baked barber?

401
00:33:15,853 --> 00:33:18,003
You finishing college
when the war's over?

402
00:33:18,173 --> 00:33:20,607
Yep. Putting my pay
and a half in war bonds.

403
00:33:20,773 --> 00:33:22,923
Working my way
through college underwater.

404
00:33:24,533 --> 00:33:27,923
Pills, if anything happened
to us while we're out on patrol...

405
00:33:28,093 --> 00:33:31,847
...if we got conked off, you figure
we'd see our folks in the hereafter?

406
00:33:32,013 --> 00:33:33,924
I wouldn't bank on it.

407
00:33:34,093 --> 00:33:38,166
My old man wouldn't be overjoyed to see
me. He never thought I was much good.

408
00:33:38,333 --> 00:33:40,722
- I like to think we got souls...
- I don't know.

409
00:33:40,893 --> 00:33:44,249
All those guys I cut up at school,
never found a soul inside.

410
00:33:44,413 --> 00:33:46,210
Well, what does that prove, Pills?

411
00:33:46,373 --> 00:33:48,170
Say you trust a guy.

412
00:33:48,333 --> 00:33:50,801
You can't see the trust,
but it's there.

413
00:33:50,973 --> 00:33:54,363
- I'm from Missouri, Mike.
- I'm not exactly religious.

414
00:33:54,533 --> 00:33:56,603
- But don't you think God...
- No, I don't.

415
00:33:56,773 --> 00:33:59,048
My angle is, I only believe
what I can see.

416
00:33:59,213 --> 00:34:01,568
- Are you an atheist?
- Call it what you like.

417
00:34:02,013 --> 00:34:04,573
The Japs turn the heat on us,
I'll watch you pray.

418
00:34:04,733 --> 00:34:06,883
I've seen it happen before.

419
00:34:08,333 --> 00:34:10,563
- Say, you guys know what?
- No, what?

420
00:34:10,733 --> 00:34:14,885
There's something screwy
about this detour or whatever it is.

421
00:34:15,613 --> 00:34:16,887
We'll know before long.

422
00:34:17,053 --> 00:34:20,489
Hey, Yo Yo, mind if I use your office?
Something private.

423
00:34:20,653 --> 00:34:22,928
- Sure.
- Thanks.

424
00:34:25,213 --> 00:34:27,852
That's the third time
he's asked me.

425
00:34:28,013 --> 00:34:29,685
Well, maybe he's writing poems.

426
00:34:29,853 --> 00:34:32,242
There you are, my little scissorbill.

427
00:34:32,413 --> 00:34:33,687
Get thee behind me.

428
00:34:33,853 --> 00:34:36,925
Mind you, no politics, no ball games,
no hair down my neck.

429
00:34:37,093 --> 00:34:38,572
Nothing but barbering.

430
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:44,048
Well, Cookie, looks like we're getting
pretty close to enemy waters.

431
00:34:44,493 --> 00:34:47,053
Now, Tommy, don't go
getting yourself all worried.

432
00:34:48,013 --> 00:34:50,129
Think we ought to take the hat off?

433
00:34:50,653 --> 00:34:52,848
Well, don't you think we'd better?

434
00:34:56,053 --> 00:34:58,408
- Clippers?
- Yes, thanks.

435
00:34:59,453 --> 00:35:03,890
You see, Tommy, there's always
one of two things about a submarine.

436
00:35:04,173 --> 00:35:08,246
In the first place, either the enemy
finds you, or he doesn't.

437
00:35:08,413 --> 00:35:11,291
If he doesn't find you,
there's nothing to worry about.

438
00:35:11,453 --> 00:35:15,241
But if he does, there is still
one of two things.

439
00:35:15,413 --> 00:35:17,768
Either he drops a depth charge,
or he don't.

440
00:35:17,933 --> 00:35:21,050
If he doesn't, there's nothing
to worry about. If he does...

441
00:35:21,213 --> 00:35:23,283
...then there's still
one of two things.

442
00:35:23,453 --> 00:35:25,683
Either he drops it
close to you or far away.

443
00:35:26,693 --> 00:35:29,253
If he drops them far away,
it's foolish to worry.

444
00:35:29,413 --> 00:35:30,846
If he drops them near you...

445
00:35:31,013 --> 00:35:34,130
...then there is still one
of two things to worry about.

446
00:35:34,293 --> 00:35:35,965
And that is...

447
00:35:36,733 --> 00:35:38,769
Don't cut too much off.

448
00:35:38,933 --> 00:35:40,491
If your pressure hull holds.

449
00:35:40,653 --> 00:35:43,531
Of course, if it holds,
wouldn't it be foolish to worry?

450
00:35:43,693 --> 00:35:46,571
If it doesn't, you won't be able
to worry, so why worry?

451
00:35:47,253 --> 00:35:48,971
Are you through?

452
00:35:49,493 --> 00:35:51,006
Yes.

453
00:35:54,573 --> 00:35:57,770
He was worth waiting for.
He's a good barber. That looks fine.

454
00:35:57,933 --> 00:35:59,207
You next?

455
00:36:14,933 --> 00:36:17,288
One thousand fathoms, sir.

456
00:36:28,933 --> 00:36:31,652
Rudder amidships. Steady on course.

457
00:36:31,813 --> 00:36:34,646
- Two-nine-zero.
- Eight hundred fathoms.

458
00:36:39,893 --> 00:36:43,852
Right, five degrees rudder.
New course, 295. All motors stop.

459
00:36:44,013 --> 00:36:48,529
Right, five degrees rudder.
New course, 295. All motors stop.

460
00:36:48,693 --> 00:36:50,012
Three hundred fathoms.

461
00:37:01,853 --> 00:37:03,366
Stations for battle surface.

462
00:37:03,533 --> 00:37:05,125
Stations for battle surface.

463
00:37:08,933 --> 00:37:10,924
Ready on all main engines.

464
00:37:23,013 --> 00:37:24,765
Down scope.

465
00:37:50,213 --> 00:37:52,249
All engines, ahead one-third.

466
00:38:28,253 --> 00:38:31,051
Has the radio man picked
up anything on the frequency?

467
00:38:31,213 --> 00:38:33,329
Contact established, sir.

468
00:38:37,613 --> 00:38:39,524
Plane to starboard, sir.

469
00:38:43,693 --> 00:38:45,411
Hold your fire.

470
00:38:46,813 --> 00:38:48,724
Stand by to challenge.

471
00:38:49,093 --> 00:38:50,367
Okay, Rocky.

472
00:38:57,493 --> 00:38:59,324
Challenge.

473
00:39:12,693 --> 00:39:15,161
Plane answered challenge
correctly, captain.

474
00:39:15,573 --> 00:39:17,609
All stop. Rudder amidships.

475
00:39:29,773 --> 00:39:32,162
Always nice to see
those stars on the wing.

476
00:40:08,013 --> 00:40:11,130
You know, I'd sure like
to hook an Aleutian salmon.

477
00:40:11,293 --> 00:40:14,091
Cute if I opened him up,
and there was a Jap in there.

478
00:40:14,253 --> 00:40:16,403
Fried Jap in tartar sauce.

479
00:40:17,093 --> 00:40:18,765
I'll take mine boiled in oil.

480
00:40:23,653 --> 00:40:25,609
I'll go down and get him.

481
00:40:40,333 --> 00:40:42,972
Lieutenant Raymond. McCary.
Welcome aboard.

482
00:40:43,133 --> 00:40:45,124
- Thank you.
- Come up, meet the captain.

483
00:40:45,293 --> 00:40:46,567
Thanks.

484
00:41:12,613 --> 00:41:14,171
Lieutenant Raymond reporting.

485
00:41:14,333 --> 00:41:16,642
- Glad to have you aboard.
- Glad to be aboard.

486
00:41:16,813 --> 00:41:19,452
- Ready on one and two.
- You already know McCary.

487
00:41:19,613 --> 00:41:21,683
- Yes, sir. We've met.
- How was your trip?

488
00:41:21,853 --> 00:41:24,765
It was pretty rough.
Is my aerology gear aboard?

489
00:41:24,933 --> 00:41:26,207
Under lock and key.

490
00:41:26,373 --> 00:41:29,410
If you'll go below, we'll arrange
for your berthing later.

491
00:41:29,573 --> 00:41:32,167
- I'd like to get this ship out of here.
- Yes, sir.

492
00:41:33,693 --> 00:41:36,890
How do I get below? I've never
been aboard a submarine before.

493
00:41:39,053 --> 00:41:40,964
There's the hatch. It goes down.

494
00:41:42,693 --> 00:41:43,967
Yes, sir.

495
00:41:47,573 --> 00:41:49,211
Hey! Bear a hand. I got a bite.

496
00:41:51,653 --> 00:41:54,247
Planes approaching, dead astern!

497
00:41:56,973 --> 00:41:58,691
Jap float Zeros.

498
00:41:58,853 --> 00:42:01,083
All ahead full!
Ten degrees right rudder!

499
00:42:03,213 --> 00:42:04,612
Commence firing!

500
00:42:13,093 --> 00:42:14,572
Get him smack in the teeth!

501
00:42:28,053 --> 00:42:29,372
Unexploded bomb forward!

502
00:42:31,893 --> 00:42:33,167
We ought to be diving.

503
00:42:33,333 --> 00:42:35,324
Got six fathoms under us.
Gotta get on.

504
00:42:49,373 --> 00:42:51,364
Coming in low! Get down!

505
00:42:54,413 --> 00:42:56,165
Good work, Wolf!

506
00:42:57,253 --> 00:42:59,369
- Is he hurt badly?
- I think so, sir.

507
00:42:59,533 --> 00:43:01,091
There he goes.

508
00:43:03,693 --> 00:43:07,288
If that Nip doesn't get out of there,
he'll end up with a hot seat.

509
00:43:15,573 --> 00:43:17,928
I could pop him off
with a clear conscience.

510
00:43:19,133 --> 00:43:20,885
He looks awful Ionesome up there.

511
00:43:21,053 --> 00:43:22,452
Okay.

512
00:43:22,613 --> 00:43:25,332
The unexploded bomb is wedged
in the superstructure.

513
00:43:25,493 --> 00:43:28,246
Let's have a look at it.
Larry, take the watch.

514
00:43:41,213 --> 00:43:44,649
Pick up that Jap aviator.
I want to question him.

515
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:51,682
We'll have to bring out
the cutting torches.

516
00:43:51,853 --> 00:43:53,445
No time.

517
00:43:55,373 --> 00:43:56,931
I'll get your pigeon for you.

518
00:43:57,093 --> 00:43:59,209
Okay, Mike.
We'll put him to roost.

519
00:44:10,213 --> 00:44:12,852
Looks like the war
is over for you, son.

520
00:44:18,733 --> 00:44:20,644
Mike!

521
00:44:32,973 --> 00:44:35,089
That's enough, kid.

522
00:44:35,693 --> 00:44:37,126
Where's Mike?

523
00:44:37,293 --> 00:44:39,170
Dakota is taking him below.

524
00:44:46,653 --> 00:44:50,089
Mike looked up like he
wanted me to do something.

525
00:44:51,013 --> 00:44:52,731
I just stood there.

526
00:44:53,013 --> 00:44:55,527
Me too. It happened so fast.

527
00:44:55,693 --> 00:44:58,491
We need a man to pull the teeth
of an unexploded bomb.

528
00:44:58,653 --> 00:45:00,962
Volunteers to the control room.

529
00:45:07,893 --> 00:45:10,612
Mike would be alive now
if I hadn't just stood there.

530
00:45:10,773 --> 00:45:13,207
Stow it. These things happen every day.

531
00:45:13,373 --> 00:45:17,446
If you want to take it out on somebody,
take it out on the Japs, not yourself.

532
00:45:17,613 --> 00:45:19,331
Come on. Let's get out of here.

533
00:45:24,213 --> 00:45:28,172
It boils down to a matter of thickness.
The bomb is wedged in a tight spot.

534
00:45:28,333 --> 00:45:30,642
And neither the captain
or I can get to it.

535
00:45:32,813 --> 00:45:35,566
Back home, they used to call me "Slim."

536
00:45:35,733 --> 00:45:37,246
You'll do, "Slim."

537
00:45:38,413 --> 00:45:40,324
Take this and that off.

538
00:45:49,253 --> 00:45:50,527
Your volunteer, captain.

539
00:45:51,693 --> 00:45:53,445
Know what you're volunteering for?

540
00:45:53,613 --> 00:45:55,285
Yes, sir. The bomb.

541
00:45:55,893 --> 00:45:59,169
It's wedged under the superstructure.
That's not all.

542
00:45:59,333 --> 00:46:03,485
That Jap may have radioed our position.
If planes come while we're down there...

543
00:46:03,653 --> 00:46:05,848
...we'll have to drink a lot of water.

544
00:46:07,333 --> 00:46:09,051
I'll go with you, captain.

545
00:46:10,253 --> 00:46:12,972
Okay, Tommy. Get down below.

546
00:46:20,453 --> 00:46:22,967
In case of another attack,
take her down.

547
00:46:24,613 --> 00:46:26,092
Aye, aye, sir.

548
00:46:27,973 --> 00:46:30,885
Clear the decks. Diving stations!

549
00:46:41,533 --> 00:46:42,807
Son...

550
00:46:42,973 --> 00:46:46,170
...that bomb may be a dud
because the firing pin's fractured.

551
00:46:46,333 --> 00:46:49,166
If it is, the slightest jar
will set it off.

552
00:46:49,453 --> 00:46:50,966
So take it very easy.

553
00:46:51,133 --> 00:46:53,567
Here. You'll need this web wrench.

554
00:46:54,293 --> 00:46:57,365
Tell me when you reach the bomb,
but don't touch it.

555
00:47:27,773 --> 00:47:29,889
- Reached the bomb.
- Don't touch it yet.

556
00:47:30,053 --> 00:47:32,726
Look carefully around
the base of the fuse.

557
00:47:33,213 --> 00:47:36,967
The bomb may be a booby trap,
so it will blow up at the slightest touch.

558
00:47:37,533 --> 00:47:41,890
Do you see any hammer marks
or slight indentations?

559
00:47:45,213 --> 00:47:47,363
- No, captain.
- All right.

560
00:47:48,293 --> 00:47:50,249
Now, very carefully...

561
00:47:50,413 --> 00:47:51,687
...feel the nose.

562
00:48:05,293 --> 00:48:06,726
Can you feel any marks?

563
00:48:07,813 --> 00:48:09,087
No marks, sir.

564
00:48:09,253 --> 00:48:11,050
Very gently now...

565
00:48:11,653 --> 00:48:14,963
...place the web wrench
around the fuse.

566
00:48:17,733 --> 00:48:20,167
It unscrews counterclockwise.

567
00:48:20,333 --> 00:48:21,607
Right to left.

568
00:48:22,733 --> 00:48:24,007
You got that?

569
00:48:24,173 --> 00:48:25,652
Yes, sir. It's in place.

570
00:48:25,813 --> 00:48:29,408
- It unscrews left to right, sir.
- Right to left! Right to left!

571
00:48:29,573 --> 00:48:30,892
I'm sorry, sir.

572
00:48:31,053 --> 00:48:33,283
I heard you all right.
I repeated it wrong.

573
00:48:33,453 --> 00:48:35,523
Right to left, sir.
I'm a little nervous.

574
00:48:35,693 --> 00:48:36,967
Stop and take a breath.

575
00:48:37,693 --> 00:48:39,445
You're doing fine.

576
00:48:42,653 --> 00:48:45,645
Well, I guess Mike
got it quicker, that's all.

577
00:48:45,813 --> 00:48:47,371
Shut up.

578
00:48:47,533 --> 00:48:50,411
- Talking don't bother a bomb.
- It bothers me.

579
00:48:53,813 --> 00:48:57,647
Dakota, I once knew a dame who had
a temperament just like a bomb.

580
00:48:57,813 --> 00:48:59,769
Laugh? No laugh.

581
00:49:00,253 --> 00:49:03,370
Start unscrewing it gently.
Just use gradual pressure.

582
00:49:03,533 --> 00:49:05,125
Right to left.

583
00:49:05,293 --> 00:49:06,726
- Right.
- Easy.

584
00:49:06,893 --> 00:49:08,884
Easy. Just loosen it.

585
00:49:21,333 --> 00:49:23,847
- I've loosened it, sir.
- Now, carefully...

586
00:49:24,013 --> 00:49:25,685
...remove the wrench.

587
00:49:26,453 --> 00:49:28,284
Turn the fuse by hand.

588
00:49:33,693 --> 00:49:35,206
Easy.

589
00:49:35,373 --> 00:49:37,204
Very, very gently, son.

590
00:49:39,253 --> 00:49:41,050
Easy does it.

591
00:50:09,493 --> 00:50:12,212
Got "made in U.S.A." stamped on it.

592
00:50:13,973 --> 00:50:16,567
The appeasers' contribution
to the war effort.

593
00:50:16,733 --> 00:50:19,201
Take it and stew it, Cookie.

594
00:50:19,453 --> 00:50:21,171
Adams, you did a fine job.

595
00:50:21,333 --> 00:50:23,528
You earned yourself a higher rating.

596
00:50:23,693 --> 00:50:25,126
Thank you, sir.

597
00:50:28,333 --> 00:50:30,927
You got a great pair
of shoes to fill, Tommy.

598
00:50:38,533 --> 00:50:40,649
One kid's shoe.

599
00:50:42,813 --> 00:50:44,929
And one pipe...

600
00:50:45,093 --> 00:50:46,412
...stem broken.

601
00:50:49,133 --> 00:50:51,363
That completes the inventory.

602
00:50:59,653 --> 00:51:02,042
Mike was a first-class
torpedoman...

603
00:51:02,213 --> 00:51:03,965
...in more ways than one.

604
00:51:11,813 --> 00:51:13,531
Where's the kid?

605
00:51:14,013 --> 00:51:15,765
He went aft. He feels kind of low.

606
00:51:15,933 --> 00:51:19,050
Wonder if we should have told
the exec about that package...

607
00:51:19,213 --> 00:51:22,444
...Mike used to keep under his sack.
- What package?

608
00:51:22,893 --> 00:51:24,212
Well...

609
00:51:24,373 --> 00:51:26,762
...every time he borrowed
Yo Yo's office...

610
00:51:26,933 --> 00:51:29,163
...he took it along with him.

611
00:51:36,493 --> 00:51:38,848
Hey, maybe it's one
of them censored records.

612
00:51:39,013 --> 00:51:40,969
Say, we could do with a laugh.

613
00:51:55,813 --> 00:51:59,328
I thought Mike was acting
secret when he used to come in here.

614
00:52:06,333 --> 00:52:07,732
<i>Hello, honey.</i>

615
00:52:07,893 --> 00:52:11,090
<i>I hope you play this record
once in a while while you're away.</i>

616
00:52:11,253 --> 00:52:13,687
<i>It'll mean you're missing
me like I miss you...</i>

617
00:52:13,853 --> 00:52:16,686
<i>... from the moment you shove off,
every single time.</i>

618
00:52:16,853 --> 00:52:21,608
<i>Have I ever told you how much those
homecoming bear hugs mean to me?</i>

619
00:52:21,773 --> 00:52:26,085
<i>Gosh, darling, you could break
all my ribs, having you back is so good.</i>

620
00:52:27,053 --> 00:52:30,568
<i>The kids miss you and make believe
you're at the table each night.</i>

621
00:52:31,813 --> 00:52:34,611
<i>I don 't think they know
what being married 10 years...</i>

622
00:52:34,773 --> 00:52:37,207
<i>... to a sweet guy like you is like.</i>

623
00:52:37,373 --> 00:52:39,284
<i>I do, thank God.</i>

624
00:52:39,453 --> 00:52:42,525
<i>Means you've made me
the happiest woman alive.</i>

625
00:52:43,453 --> 00:52:45,887
<i>I hope I've made you happy, Mike.</i>

626
00:52:46,053 --> 00:52:47,884
<i>I always tried my darnedest...</i>

627
00:52:48,053 --> 00:52:49,406
<i>... because I love you...</i>

628
00:52:49,573 --> 00:52:51,211
<i>... with every bit of my heart.</i>

629
00:53:13,053 --> 00:53:15,203
"And whilst we consign...

630
00:53:15,373 --> 00:53:17,841
...his remains to the deep...

631
00:53:18,013 --> 00:53:21,847
...we the living
pray thee heavenly Father...

632
00:53:22,013 --> 00:53:25,130
...to grant him eternal peace
and rest...

633
00:53:25,453 --> 00:53:27,444
...through Christ Jesus, our Lord."

634
00:53:27,893 --> 00:53:29,292
Amen.

635
00:54:02,493 --> 00:54:04,404
Why weren't you up there?

636
00:54:07,253 --> 00:54:08,811
I got no use for burials.

637
00:54:14,413 --> 00:54:17,052
Oh, coffee's more important, huh?

638
00:54:21,613 --> 00:54:24,650
- You don't think I care he's dead?
- Why didn't you come up?

639
00:54:24,813 --> 00:54:28,123
- Sorry for that Jap?
- Shut up! I don't take that from nobody!

640
00:54:35,653 --> 00:54:38,611
I'm surprised at you guys, all of you.

641
00:54:39,453 --> 00:54:43,685
You ought to have sense enough
not to get such dumb ideas!

642
00:54:46,053 --> 00:54:48,328
- I told you, I had my reasons.
- Bilge!

643
00:55:00,573 --> 00:55:02,370
Look.

644
00:55:02,533 --> 00:55:05,286
I had an uncle lived
in the old country, see.

645
00:55:05,453 --> 00:55:08,126
A real high-class guy, not like me.

646
00:55:08,293 --> 00:55:09,806
You know what he was?

647
00:55:09,973 --> 00:55:12,123
He was a teacher of philosophy.

648
00:55:12,293 --> 00:55:14,682
To be that in Greece,
the home of philosophy...

649
00:55:14,853 --> 00:55:18,243
...you got to be A-number-one smart,
and that was my uncle.

650
00:55:18,413 --> 00:55:20,005
So they killed him, them Nazis.

651
00:55:20,173 --> 00:55:22,733
They stood him up against the wall.
You know why?

652
00:55:22,893 --> 00:55:24,451
Because he had brains.

653
00:55:24,613 --> 00:55:29,084
And everybody's got to be their slave.
Them that won't, like my uncle, they kill.

654
00:55:32,853 --> 00:55:34,809
My old man was no good.

655
00:55:34,973 --> 00:55:37,533
He was a boozer.
He died in bed having the D.T.'s.

656
00:55:38,893 --> 00:55:41,965
But my uncle,
a man with education and charity...

657
00:55:42,133 --> 00:55:44,363
...who used to send my ma
what to eat with.

658
00:55:44,533 --> 00:55:48,128
Him, they stood up against the wall.
And that sticks in here with me.

659
00:55:48,293 --> 00:55:50,204
The difference between
them and us...

660
00:55:50,373 --> 00:55:54,844
...is, with us even the no-good
gets a chance to die in his own bed.

661
00:55:55,573 --> 00:55:57,609
So I don't forget my uncle.

662
00:55:58,213 --> 00:56:00,966
An American flier gets killed,
I think of my uncle.

663
00:56:01,133 --> 00:56:04,569
I see pictures of Chinese kids
getting bombed, I think of my uncle.

664
00:56:04,733 --> 00:56:07,372
A Russian guerrilla gets hanged,
I think of my uncle.

665
00:56:07,533 --> 00:56:10,206
I see Mike lying in there dead,
I think of my uncle.

666
00:56:10,373 --> 00:56:13,285
I ain't got room in here
to see one of our guys get buried.

667
00:56:13,453 --> 00:56:16,286
Not yet. Not until I've done
something to even the score.

668
00:56:16,453 --> 00:56:18,728
So I eat with it, and I sleep with it.

669
00:56:19,173 --> 00:56:21,084
So be sore at me, you dopes.

670
00:56:24,813 --> 00:56:27,202
- I'm sorry, Tin Can.
- Attention.

671
00:56:30,133 --> 00:56:31,691
At ease, men.

672
00:56:36,653 --> 00:56:38,883
- Trying to figure out about Mike?
- Yes, sir.

673
00:56:40,933 --> 00:56:42,571
Well...

674
00:56:42,733 --> 00:56:45,531
...officers and men on submarines
are closer together...

675
00:56:45,693 --> 00:56:47,570
...than in most branches of our Navy.

676
00:56:47,733 --> 00:56:49,564
Mike was with me on my first patrol.

677
00:56:50,093 --> 00:56:52,653
He was my friend. I know his family.

678
00:56:53,133 --> 00:56:56,011
His wife's a fine, great-hearted woman.

679
00:56:56,733 --> 00:56:58,485
I know his kids.

680
00:56:59,853 --> 00:57:04,927
I remember Mike's pride when he bought
the first pair of roller skates for his boy.

681
00:57:05,213 --> 00:57:08,011
They were the finest roller skates
that money could buy.

682
00:57:08,453 --> 00:57:10,091
Roller skates for a 5-year-old.

683
00:57:11,173 --> 00:57:14,404
Well, that Jap got a present too,
when he was 5.

684
00:57:14,573 --> 00:57:16,165
Only it was a dagger.

685
00:57:16,573 --> 00:57:20,327
His old man gave him a dagger, so he'd
know what he was supposed to be.

686
00:57:20,493 --> 00:57:22,882
The Japs have a ceremony
that goes with it.

687
00:57:23,053 --> 00:57:27,365
At 7, a Jap kid is taking marches
under an army instructor.

688
00:57:27,533 --> 00:57:30,889
At 13, he can put a machine
gun together blindfolded.

689
00:57:32,173 --> 00:57:36,883
That Jap started on the road 20 years
ago to putting a knife in Mike's back.

690
00:57:39,133 --> 00:57:41,488
There are lots of Mikes dying right now.

691
00:57:41,653 --> 00:57:43,564
And a lot more Mikes will die...

692
00:57:43,733 --> 00:57:48,807
...until we wipe out a system that puts
daggers in the hands of 5-year-olds.

693
00:57:49,573 --> 00:57:51,165
You know...

694
00:57:51,333 --> 00:57:53,722
...if Mike were here to put
it into words now...

695
00:57:53,893 --> 00:57:56,202
...that's just about what he died for.

696
00:57:56,373 --> 00:57:58,648
More roller skates in this world.

697
00:57:59,333 --> 00:58:02,803
Including some for the next
generation of Japanese kids...

698
00:58:03,373 --> 00:58:06,206
...because that's the kind
of a man Mike was.

699
00:58:47,053 --> 00:58:50,284
- What's that you're reading?
- San Francisco telephone directory.

700
00:58:50,453 --> 00:58:52,648
- I collect names.
- What do you do with them?

701
00:58:53,053 --> 00:58:56,329
Just meditate. Wonder what kind
of people go with the names.

702
00:58:56,493 --> 00:58:59,849
- Wonder what the names mean.
- Names don't mean nothing.

703
00:59:00,013 --> 00:59:01,731
- Oh, no?
- No.

704
00:59:01,893 --> 00:59:04,453
- Well, my name's Wainwright.
- Wainwright. So what?

705
00:59:04,613 --> 00:59:08,845
My grandpa used to build wagons. A
wainwright's a guy who builds wagons.

706
00:59:09,013 --> 00:59:11,049
- Like covered wagons?
- Sure.

707
00:59:11,213 --> 00:59:13,852
Maybe he built some
wagons crossed the plains.

708
00:59:14,013 --> 00:59:17,244
Some grandpas built houses.
Name's Carpenter.

709
00:59:17,413 --> 00:59:20,371
Some grandpas made clothes.
Name's Tailor.

710
00:59:21,413 --> 00:59:24,211
Some guy's grandpa built wheels
for my grandpa's wagons.

711
00:59:24,373 --> 00:59:26,568
Name's Wheelwright,
a guy who builds wheels.

712
00:59:26,733 --> 00:59:30,009
Sun lamp ready in the forward room.
Come on, GI sunshine.

713
00:59:30,173 --> 00:59:33,290
Don't tell me the captain
finally gave up that sun lamp.

714
00:59:34,133 --> 00:59:36,647
Phone books are fascinating.
I'm nuts about them.

715
00:59:36,813 --> 00:59:39,122
Personally, I use phone books
for long shots.

716
00:59:39,293 --> 00:59:42,205
In San Diego, I had nothing to do
and nothing on my mind...

717
00:59:42,373 --> 00:59:43,692
Except skirts.

718
00:59:43,853 --> 00:59:46,925
So I sees this phone book.
I flip it open. I come to a name.

719
00:59:47,093 --> 00:59:48,412
Rosalie Riley.

720
00:59:48,573 --> 00:59:51,883
"Pretty name," I says to myself.
"I wonder what she's like."

721
00:59:52,053 --> 00:59:53,805
- So...
- So you call her up.

722
00:59:53,973 --> 00:59:55,565
No. Why waste time?

723
00:59:55,733 --> 00:59:58,566
I go right out to her house,
21 Valley Road.

724
00:59:58,733 --> 01:00:01,167
Never forget it.
Had roses all over the place.

725
01:00:01,333 --> 01:00:03,085
Very pretty. Very pretty indeed.

726
01:00:03,253 --> 01:00:05,926
- Red and pink roses...
- Now we're going to pick roses.

727
01:00:06,093 --> 01:00:09,881
I pick a rose. So I got something to talk
about when she comes to the door.

728
01:00:11,373 --> 01:00:12,726
Up I go to the door.

729
01:00:12,893 --> 01:00:16,886
I ring the bell. And I hear
a very nice voice from the inside.

730
01:00:17,053 --> 01:00:19,851
"Wait a minute," she says.
"I'm in the bathtub."

731
01:00:20,013 --> 01:00:22,243
Every girl you meet is in the bathtub!

732
01:00:22,413 --> 01:00:25,246
I haven't met her yet. I'm on her porch!

733
01:00:25,813 --> 01:00:27,849
Naturally, I sit down.

734
01:00:28,013 --> 01:00:30,846
I'm rocking back and forth,
back and forth.

735
01:00:31,013 --> 01:00:33,402
Skip the details.
Who cares if you're rocking?

736
01:00:33,573 --> 01:00:36,007
I'm just trying to give you the picture!

737
01:00:37,253 --> 01:00:38,572
We got the picture!

738
01:00:38,733 --> 01:00:41,088
You're in the bathtub!
She's on the porch!

739
01:00:41,933 --> 01:00:45,608
She's in the bathtub.
I'm on the porch!

740
01:00:46,893 --> 01:00:49,691
She comes to the door.
My stomach flutters.

741
01:00:49,853 --> 01:00:52,492
- She's beautiful!
- Now his stomach flutters.

742
01:00:53,533 --> 01:00:57,446
"Oh," she says, "I thought you were
someone else. " "Disappointed?" I says.

743
01:00:57,613 --> 01:00:59,365
You're there
with a snappy comeback.

744
01:00:59,533 --> 01:01:01,524
She says,
"I can't ask you to come in."

745
01:01:01,693 --> 01:01:05,845
"Of course not," I says, giving her pearly
teeth. "But I can ask you to come out."

746
01:01:06,013 --> 01:01:07,412
What did she say to that?

747
01:01:07,573 --> 01:01:10,246
Well, she didn't say anything,
that is, right away.

748
01:01:10,413 --> 01:01:12,608
Then I proceeded to pour
on the personality.

749
01:01:12,773 --> 01:01:14,331
Then what did you do?

750
01:01:14,653 --> 01:01:16,689
Now, wouldn't you like to know?

751
01:01:16,853 --> 01:01:20,004
You give me a pain in the pancreas.
You're always shooting off.

752
01:01:20,173 --> 01:01:23,688
Stow it for the rest of this patrol.
Some of us have sweethearts.

753
01:01:23,853 --> 01:01:26,890
Yeah?
Well, maybe some of us haven't.

754
01:01:29,613 --> 01:01:31,331
Hasn't he been telling the truth?

755
01:01:31,493 --> 01:01:36,089
No. You haven't been swallowing
all that stuff, have you?

756
01:02:20,773 --> 01:02:22,491
Captain.

757
01:02:23,053 --> 01:02:24,884
Oh, this it?

758
01:02:25,053 --> 01:02:27,044
I'm afraid to take a look.

759
01:02:28,853 --> 01:02:31,242
Just hope it won't be Coney Island.

760
01:02:31,853 --> 01:02:34,083
Well, I got on my lucky sweater.

761
01:02:49,933 --> 01:02:51,924
What's the bearing?

762
01:02:52,093 --> 01:02:54,243
Zero-five-zero, captain.

763
01:03:09,733 --> 01:03:12,770
Smack on the button. Take a look.

764
01:03:18,693 --> 01:03:22,208
Right down Fujiyama's throat.

765
01:03:22,373 --> 01:03:24,887
Nice work, Andy.
Check your tangents.

766
01:03:29,133 --> 01:03:31,488
Lieutenant Raymond
to the conning tower.

767
01:03:33,133 --> 01:03:35,010
Attention, all hands.

768
01:03:35,173 --> 01:03:39,166
We're lying off the Japanese mainland.
Thought you'd like to know.

769
01:03:39,893 --> 01:03:42,088
Just like the postcards, huh?

770
01:03:42,253 --> 01:03:44,813
You get a better look inside the bay,
captain.

771
01:03:45,093 --> 01:03:48,449
By the way, you think you can
get inside the net?

772
01:03:48,733 --> 01:03:51,122
- That's what orders say.
- What about minefields?

773
01:03:51,293 --> 01:03:54,091
- Can you see them underwater?
- Nope. I wish I could.

774
01:03:54,253 --> 01:03:57,290
But if you do get in, how are you
going to get the ship out?

775
01:03:57,933 --> 01:04:00,128
This is a sort of blind date, Raymond.

776
01:04:00,293 --> 01:04:03,524
- We have to wait and see what happens.
- Got my tangents, captain.

777
01:04:03,693 --> 01:04:06,526
Okay, Andy. Down scope.

778
01:04:07,853 --> 01:04:10,970
We'll break out a chart
of the probable minefields.

779
01:04:11,173 --> 01:04:15,485
Well, boys, looks as if
we have to wait for a ticket in.

780
01:04:19,972 --> 01:04:23,203
This is going to be like waiting
to have your first tooth yanked.

781
01:04:24,532 --> 01:04:26,762
Checking the gravity, captain.

782
01:04:28,932 --> 01:04:32,163
How'd you happen to volunteer
for the submarine service, captain?

783
01:04:32,492 --> 01:04:33,766
Well, when I was a kid...

784
01:04:33,932 --> 01:04:36,969
...I used to get a kick
out of swimming underwater.

785
01:04:39,092 --> 01:04:42,402
How's your wife feel about
your shoving off on these patrols?

786
01:04:42,692 --> 01:04:45,445
The way the wives of all the men
in the services feel.

787
01:04:45,612 --> 01:04:47,967
Did she know what she
was getting into?

788
01:04:48,132 --> 01:04:49,611
Not when she met me.

789
01:04:49,772 --> 01:04:52,081
She was a blind date.

790
01:04:52,412 --> 01:04:54,801
Not quite the same as the date
we've got ahead.

791
01:04:54,972 --> 01:04:57,406
It was dark. I couldn't see
what she looked like.

792
01:04:57,572 --> 01:04:59,767
- You find out what she looked like?
- Yes.

793
01:04:59,932 --> 01:05:02,730
You see, we have two kids by now.

794
01:05:03,772 --> 01:05:05,888
I meant that night, sir.

795
01:05:06,052 --> 01:05:07,565
No.

796
01:05:07,932 --> 01:05:12,050
But I found you didn't need to know
what a girl looked like to like her.

797
01:05:12,332 --> 01:05:16,041
I liked her voice, the things she said,
the way she laughed.

798
01:05:16,212 --> 01:05:17,930
Still do.

799
01:05:18,252 --> 01:05:20,971
I like the way she is with our kids.

800
01:05:21,852 --> 01:05:23,763
I like everything about her.

801
01:05:24,732 --> 01:05:27,121
What made you pick the Navy,
Raymond?

802
01:05:27,292 --> 01:05:29,248
Well, I was born and raised in Tokyo.

803
01:05:29,412 --> 01:05:31,209
Tokyo, Japan?

804
01:05:31,372 --> 01:05:33,886
- You speak Japanese?
- Yes, he does.

805
01:05:34,052 --> 01:05:36,885
- We expect to make good use of it soon.
- Let's hear some.
