1
00:00:18,732 --> 00:00:20,211
I'm sorry, captain.

2
00:00:20,372 --> 00:00:23,011
I thought there was a Jap
loose onboard ship.

3
00:00:23,732 --> 00:00:25,802
It was Mr. Raymond.

4
00:00:30,092 --> 00:00:33,971
The democratic movement in Japan
after the last war, what happened to it?

5
00:00:34,132 --> 00:00:36,851
- The leaders were assassinated.
- What of the people?

6
00:00:37,012 --> 00:00:39,845
They have no voice now.
Starvation is the big stick.

7
00:00:40,012 --> 00:00:42,890
That's right, sir.
A big wage is $ 7 a week.

8
00:00:43,052 --> 00:00:45,202
They have no unions,
no free press, nothing.

9
00:00:45,372 --> 00:00:48,409
- They do what they're told.
- Most believe what they're told.

10
00:00:48,572 --> 00:00:50,927
Like that hero
who knifed your torpedoman.

11
00:00:51,092 --> 00:00:55,608
- They were sold a swindle and accept it.
- How can they support such big families?

12
00:00:55,772 --> 00:01:00,482
They don't. Daughters of the poor
are often sold to factories or worse...

13
00:01:00,652 --> 00:01:01,971
...when they're about 12.

14
00:01:02,132 --> 00:01:05,249
Females are useful there only to work
or to have children.

15
00:01:05,412 --> 00:01:08,245
The Japs don't understand
the love we have for our women.

16
00:01:08,412 --> 00:01:10,926
They don't even have a word for it.

17
00:01:11,092 --> 00:01:14,767
Picking up something directly aft,
captain. Bearing, 180.

18
00:01:16,892 --> 00:01:20,601
- All stop. Up scope.
- All answering stopped, sir.

19
00:01:20,772 --> 00:01:24,048
Sounds like a cruiser limping in,
destroyers escorting.

20
00:01:38,492 --> 00:01:44,522
She's a heavy cruiser, deep in the water,
coming home sick, destroyers for nurses.

21
00:01:45,012 --> 00:01:48,607
- Down scope.
- Dead duck, captain?

22
00:01:48,772 --> 00:01:52,845
Live duck. No torpedoes.
This is our ticket to the feeding grounds.

23
00:01:55,012 --> 00:01:57,890
- Range on cruiser, soundman.
- 4200 yards, sir.

24
00:01:58,492 --> 00:02:02,087
Should be tugs coming to help her.
Surge ahead, entrance to Tokyo Bay.

25
00:02:02,252 --> 00:02:04,004
Aye, aye, sir.

26
00:02:22,292 --> 00:02:25,841
Picking up several ships, confused
sound. Maybe three, maybe four.

27
00:02:26,012 --> 00:02:27,445
Good.

28
00:02:29,372 --> 00:02:32,364
- Ten degrees dive on bow planes.
- Ten degrees on bow planes.

29
00:02:32,532 --> 00:02:34,921
- All ahead one-third.
- The Japs don't know it...

30
00:02:35,092 --> 00:02:39,210
...but they've sent us an invitation.
- All answering ahead one-third, sir.

31
00:02:39,372 --> 00:02:41,203
Blow negative.

32
00:02:41,372 --> 00:02:44,728
- Close negative flood.
- Negative flood closed.

33
00:02:44,892 --> 00:02:47,611
- Zero bubble.
- Zero bubble.

34
00:02:47,772 --> 00:02:51,401
That cruiser's probably picking up
a plane escort overhead.

35
00:02:52,372 --> 00:02:56,445
- You figure we're right here, huh?
- And the minefields will start in there.

36
00:02:57,972 --> 00:03:03,842
They're a cinch to have a sounding
device to detect uninvited guests like us.

37
00:03:04,172 --> 00:03:06,447
Small ships passing over, sir.

38
00:03:11,612 --> 00:03:14,922
And making so much noise
their destroyers can't hear us.

39
00:03:15,092 --> 00:03:17,447
"Live duck," he says.

40
00:03:17,612 --> 00:03:21,161
Did you guys hear the skipper say
we're not firing any torpedoes?

41
00:03:21,332 --> 00:03:25,564
Our mission was Tokyo Bay. Okay, we're
here. What are we doing, sightseeing?

42
00:03:25,732 --> 00:03:29,850
What's the matter, Tommy?
Scared with all the company over us?

43
00:03:30,012 --> 00:03:32,162
I'm not scared, yet.

44
00:03:32,332 --> 00:03:35,290
<i>Tugboats have contacted
cruiser and destroyers.</i>

45
00:03:35,612 --> 00:03:38,365
- A description of what we ain't sinking!
- Shut up.

46
00:03:38,532 --> 00:03:41,808
- It's a free country!
- Not where we're sitting, it ain't.

47
00:03:41,972 --> 00:03:43,644
Right in the Nips' birdbath.

48
00:03:44,252 --> 00:03:45,810
<i>Attention, all hands.</i>

49
00:03:45,972 --> 00:03:49,726
We're going to take a chance following
this cruiser through the minefields.

50
00:03:49,892 --> 00:03:53,885
From now on, normal talking is okay,
but be careful of striking metal on metal.

51
00:03:54,492 --> 00:03:57,370
<i>You all know sound travels
far and clear underwater...</i>

52
00:03:57,532 --> 00:04:01,923
<i>... when it's being sucked in by Jap
listening devices above us or onshore.</i>

53
00:04:02,092 --> 00:04:05,289
<i>It's essential that we get
as near to Tokyo as possible.</i>

54
00:04:05,452 --> 00:04:09,286
<i>In addition to mines, there's
certainly a submarine net ahead...</i>

55
00:04:09,452 --> 00:04:11,966
<i>... just waiting for screwballs like us.</i>

56
00:04:12,132 --> 00:04:16,330
The cruiser will be passing any minute.
They'll lower the gate to let her through.

57
00:04:16,492 --> 00:04:18,801
I'm banking on the tugs and cruiser...

58
00:04:18,972 --> 00:04:21,611
...to keep our motor sound
from being picked up.

59
00:04:21,772 --> 00:04:25,845
Stand by. Keep on your toes. Soundman?

60
00:04:29,692 --> 00:04:31,603
Cruiser's starting to pass overhead.

61
00:04:41,412 --> 00:04:45,485
- All ahead two-thirds, steady as you go.
- All ahead two-thirds, steady as you go.

62
00:04:47,852 --> 00:04:51,003
- How's their speed?
- Slowed a few rpms, captain.

63
00:04:51,172 --> 00:04:52,446
Good. That helps us.

64
00:05:13,012 --> 00:05:14,809
Bearing zero.

65
00:05:18,412 --> 00:05:20,926
Bring her up to 55 feet, keel depth.

66
00:06:13,252 --> 00:06:15,402
Anything I can do, sir?

67
00:06:15,572 --> 00:06:18,769
You can join us in holding our breath.

68
00:06:19,652 --> 00:06:22,530
We're trying this on for size.

69
00:06:47,572 --> 00:06:51,850
- Can we hug the cruiser any closer?
- We're just about kissing her now, sir.

70
00:06:56,012 --> 00:07:00,528
If we kiss her bottom,
we get an ashcan right down our neck.

71
00:07:03,452 --> 00:07:06,842
Bearing zero.
Picking up gate vessels off both beams.

72
00:07:10,132 --> 00:07:13,568
We're approaching their submarine net,
Mr. Raymond.

73
00:07:16,852 --> 00:07:21,642
Men, you may all join me
in a silent prayer.

74
00:07:37,652 --> 00:07:40,485
They may not lower the net enough.

75
00:07:41,892 --> 00:07:44,167
We got to take a chance.

76
00:07:46,572 --> 00:07:49,166
Plane up to 45 feet, keel depth.

77
00:09:17,812 --> 00:09:19,882
Attention, all hands.

78
00:09:20,612 --> 00:09:24,525
That bottom you're feeling
is well inside Tokyo Bay.

79
00:09:24,692 --> 00:09:29,686
We'll spend the rest of our first day here
as guests of the Imperial Japanese Navy.

80
00:09:30,812 --> 00:09:33,406
Say, Tommy,
are you sure you feel all right?

81
00:09:35,212 --> 00:09:37,806
Don't think I'd get sick
in the bottom of Tokyo Bay?

82
00:09:37,972 --> 00:09:41,169
It'll be dark upstairs soon.
We'll surface to charge batteries.

83
00:09:41,332 --> 00:09:44,290
I can ask the exec
to let you have some air on the bridge.

84
00:09:44,452 --> 00:09:46,124
No, thanks.
I'm all right, honest.

85
00:09:46,292 --> 00:09:48,203
Aye, aye, sir.

86
00:09:48,372 --> 00:09:51,682
Hey, Wolf, captain wants you
in his stateroom right away.

87
00:09:54,292 --> 00:09:56,283
Now what have I done?

88
00:09:58,372 --> 00:10:01,011
Skipper probably wants information
on Japanese dames.

89
00:10:11,172 --> 00:10:12,605
Yes, sir?

90
00:10:12,812 --> 00:10:15,485
Wolf, how would you like
a little shore leave?

91
00:10:16,212 --> 00:10:18,203
- When, sir?
- Tonight.

92
00:10:18,372 --> 00:10:20,932
- Tonight?
- Sit down.

93
00:10:21,092 --> 00:10:23,526
- Sit down.
- Yes, sir.

94
00:10:25,012 --> 00:10:27,890
Wolf, you've been with me
on five patrols.

95
00:10:28,052 --> 00:10:30,612
I've watched you under fire.
You don't scare easy.

96
00:10:30,772 --> 00:10:35,084
I'm gonna ask you to do something. You
can turn it down. It won't go further.

97
00:10:35,252 --> 00:10:38,642
- Well, just give me the orders, captain.
- This isn't an order.

98
00:10:38,812 --> 00:10:41,565
If you go, you go voluntarily.

99
00:10:42,292 --> 00:10:43,566
You might not come back.

100
00:10:46,532 --> 00:10:50,286
It has to do with why we haven't
betrayed our position by sinking ships.

101
00:10:50,452 --> 00:10:51,726
Yes, sir?

102
00:10:51,892 --> 00:10:54,804
We're putting three men ashore
to obtain vital data.

103
00:10:54,972 --> 00:10:57,566
- That's why we're here.
- I'll go, captain.

104
00:10:58,292 --> 00:11:01,090
Good. Come with me, Wolf.

105
00:11:08,412 --> 00:11:11,085
- Hi, Sparks.
- Hi, Wolf.

106
00:11:11,252 --> 00:11:14,164
- Here's your other volunteer.
- Glad to have you with me.

107
00:11:14,332 --> 00:11:18,291
- Thank you, sir.
- No "sir" stuff. There won't be time.

108
00:11:18,452 --> 00:11:20,682
Well, let's get down to facts.

109
00:11:21,212 --> 00:11:24,682
Under the command of Admiral Halsey,
our aircraft carriers...

110
00:11:24,852 --> 00:11:29,448
<i>...the Hornet and the Enterprise left the
United States two weeks after we did.</i>

111
00:11:29,612 --> 00:11:31,648
They've followed our course.

112
00:11:31,812 --> 00:11:34,929
At the present time,
they're approaching this position.

113
00:11:35,732 --> 00:11:39,327
The purpose of this combined operation
is the first bombing of Japan.

114
00:11:42,892 --> 00:11:45,452
Sit down.

115
00:11:45,612 --> 00:11:48,046
Lieutenant Raymond
will tell you your mission.

116
00:11:48,212 --> 00:11:52,171
Bombing planes must have information
necessary to a successful operation.

117
00:11:52,332 --> 00:11:54,527
The weather, shore installations...

118
00:11:54,692 --> 00:11:59,083
...barrage balloon positions and the
number and location of Japanese ships.

119
00:11:59,252 --> 00:12:02,289
We'll get that information to them
by radio.

120
00:12:02,452 --> 00:12:06,889
<i>After you are ashore, the Copperfin will
proceed as near as possible to Tokyo.</i>

121
00:12:07,052 --> 00:12:09,930
We'll obtain data
that our fliers need on that city.

122
00:12:10,092 --> 00:12:13,368
- That will be transferred to you.
- Pardon me, sir...

123
00:12:13,532 --> 00:12:17,161
...how will we know our way around?
- I was raised in Japan.

124
00:12:17,332 --> 00:12:19,482
We've chosen a spot
that I know very well.

125
00:12:19,652 --> 00:12:22,086
- Isn't the coast one city after another?
- No.

126
00:12:22,252 --> 00:12:25,244
Actually, it's very similar
to that of California.

127
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:28,449
The spot we've picked is a Ionely one.

128
00:12:29,212 --> 00:12:31,965
This special clothing
has been provided for you.

129
00:12:32,132 --> 00:12:33,884
- Anything wrong, sir?
- Oh, no.

130
00:12:34,052 --> 00:12:36,850
We always dim the lights
45 minutes before we surface.

131
00:12:37,012 --> 00:12:40,163
It allows our eyes to get accustomed
to the darkness.

132
00:12:40,572 --> 00:12:44,724
If you run into any geisha girls on
any porches just out of any bathtubs...

133
00:12:44,892 --> 00:12:46,848
...don't pick any roses.

134
00:12:47,972 --> 00:12:49,849
<i>Shore party to the conning tower.</i>

135
00:12:50,012 --> 00:12:52,651
<i>- Good luck, Wolf.
- Don't forget that bottle of sake.</i>

136
00:12:52,812 --> 00:12:54,882
Give the emperor a boot for me,
will you?

137
00:12:55,052 --> 00:12:57,566
See that Nita doesn't get Ionesome
while I'm gone.

138
00:12:57,732 --> 00:12:59,165
Be good.

139
00:12:59,572 --> 00:13:02,132
- So long, guys.
- So long, Wolf.

140
00:13:02,292 --> 00:13:05,443
- Ready to go, sir.
- Stand by in the conning tower, Wolf.

141
00:13:05,612 --> 00:13:08,285
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Send us a postcard, kid.

142
00:13:08,452 --> 00:13:10,761
- Happy landings, fella.
- Lot of luck, pal.

143
00:13:10,932 --> 00:13:12,524
Don't take any wooden yen.

144
00:13:14,292 --> 00:13:17,409
- Say, Wolf, how come they picked you?
- I don't know.

145
00:13:17,572 --> 00:13:20,211
Strong arms, strong back, weak mind.

146
00:13:20,372 --> 00:13:22,932
- Pass the word, battle stations.
- Battle stations.

147
00:13:23,092 --> 00:13:25,083
Battle stations.

148
00:13:27,212 --> 00:13:29,168
Stand by to surface.

149
00:13:30,252 --> 00:13:32,971
- Soundman, make another check.
- All clear, sir.

150
00:13:33,132 --> 00:13:34,929
Blow negative.

151
00:13:36,252 --> 00:13:39,961
- Put a bubble in safety.
- Bubble in safety.

152
00:13:45,972 --> 00:13:49,009
All ahead one-third.
Plane up to periscope depth.

153
00:14:07,572 --> 00:14:11,042
Once you're in the boat, we'll submerge
and proceed north to Tokyo...

154
00:14:11,212 --> 00:14:13,043
...to get the necessary information.

155
00:14:13,212 --> 00:14:16,488
If all goes well, we'll return
to this position tomorrow night...

156
00:14:16,652 --> 00:14:19,041
...and surface at 0130.

157
00:14:19,212 --> 00:14:23,569
One of you will meet us in the boat
to get the Tokyo and Yokohama data.

158
00:14:23,732 --> 00:14:27,486
<i>We'll submerge and await completion
of your shortwave to the Hornet.</i>

159
00:14:27,652 --> 00:14:29,165
- Is that clear?
- Yes, sir.

160
00:14:29,332 --> 00:14:32,369
At 0330, we'll surface again.

161
00:14:32,532 --> 00:14:36,366
If you've completed your transmission
and are ready to return to the ship...

162
00:14:36,532 --> 00:14:39,569
...what letter will you flash?
- C if it's clear.

163
00:14:39,732 --> 00:14:42,292
- And if a Jap patrol is onshore?
- J.

164
00:14:42,452 --> 00:14:46,127
Right. Then you return to cover
until the next night.

165
00:14:46,292 --> 00:14:48,965
We won't respond to your signal,
but we'll be here...

166
00:14:49,132 --> 00:14:52,886
...every night at the same time
until your mission is completed.

167
00:14:53,052 --> 00:14:54,531
Any questions?

168
00:15:02,692 --> 00:15:05,923
Vent safety. All stop.
Make another sweep, soundman.

169
00:15:07,372 --> 00:15:10,205
- All clear, sir.
- Up scope.

170
00:15:34,772 --> 00:15:37,047
Boat detail, stand by.

171
00:15:38,012 --> 00:15:39,570
Down scope.

172
00:15:41,372 --> 00:15:42,805
Surface.

173
00:15:45,852 --> 00:15:47,729
Douse the lights.

174
00:15:57,572 --> 00:15:59,802
Douse that hatch light.

175
00:16:09,972 --> 00:16:11,724
Crack the hatch.

176
00:16:30,252 --> 00:16:31,924
All clear aft.

177
00:16:32,092 --> 00:16:34,242
All clear port.

178
00:16:34,412 --> 00:16:36,368
All clear starboard.

179
00:16:38,052 --> 00:16:41,328
Boat detail, on deck.
Load the gear. Step lively.

180
00:16:57,532 --> 00:17:00,126
Get your eyes accustomed to the night.

181
00:17:07,012 --> 00:17:09,572
You might get a medal
if you keep your skins whole.

182
00:17:09,732 --> 00:17:13,611
- We'll work along those lines, sir.
- Sir, I'll work on keeping my skin whole.

183
00:17:17,732 --> 00:17:19,563
- Good luck, Raymond.
- Thank you, sir.

184
00:17:19,732 --> 00:17:22,610
- Good luck, Wolf. Good luck, Sparks.
- Thank you, sir.

185
00:17:34,652 --> 00:17:36,290
Wish I were going with them.

186
00:17:36,452 --> 00:17:40,206
Are you kidding? I need you onboard.
I might break a leg.

187
00:17:48,052 --> 00:17:50,122
Stand by to dive.

188
00:17:51,932 --> 00:17:54,890
Figured out how close we can get
to Tokyo, Andy?

189
00:17:55,052 --> 00:17:57,282
Course is charted, captain.

190
00:17:57,652 --> 00:17:59,688
Let's pull the cork.

191
00:18:55,412 --> 00:18:58,006
Get loaded.
Head up the trail to the top.

192
00:19:42,452 --> 00:19:46,730
You know, we're kind of like the pilgrims
on Plymouth Rock.

193
00:20:01,052 --> 00:20:03,202
Sixty-two-point-zero.

194
00:20:05,172 --> 00:20:07,242
Fifty-nine-point-five.

195
00:20:17,532 --> 00:20:19,090
Eighty-eight.

196
00:20:48,532 --> 00:20:50,523
You picking up anything, Sparks?

197
00:20:51,452 --> 00:20:55,240
Tokyo Rose, giving out with that
nightly guff to the U.S.A. Listen to this.

198
00:20:55,412 --> 00:20:57,004
<i>- Never been defeated in a war.</i>

199
00:20:57,172 --> 00:21:00,687
<i>The sooner you Americans realize
that Japan is invincible, the better.</i>

200
00:21:00,852 --> 00:21:04,367
<i>So perfect is the iron ring of defense
the great leaders have built...</i>

201
00:21:04,532 --> 00:21:08,844
<i>... that no American ship dares approach
within 500 miles of her sacred shores.</i>

202
00:21:09,012 --> 00:21:10,923
<i>The submarine menace
has been removed.</i>

203
00:21:11,092 --> 00:21:14,721
<i>The American Navy is afraid
to tell its people of tremendous losses...</i>

204
00:21:14,892 --> 00:21:18,089
<i>... suffered at the hands
of the Japanese fleet. The American...</i>

205
00:21:18,252 --> 00:21:21,403
If you don't need me for a while,
I'll thumb a ride to Tokyo...

206
00:21:21,572 --> 00:21:24,006
...and silence that dame, but good!

207
00:21:37,492 --> 00:21:39,960
Two flattops
building on the ship's ways.

208
00:21:42,852 --> 00:21:47,642
One heavy cruiser in dock,
three outside.

209
00:21:50,172 --> 00:21:53,926
Barrage balloons over large steel plant.

210
00:21:54,972 --> 00:21:58,408
Oil storage tanks on rise to the south.

211
00:22:01,012 --> 00:22:03,287
Here comes a tin can. Down scope.

212
00:22:05,332 --> 00:22:07,243
Take her down to 100.

213
00:22:21,172 --> 00:22:22,605
Coming this way. Close now.

214
00:22:22,772 --> 00:22:26,321
Let's hope they're not listening
in their own harbor.

215
00:22:32,012 --> 00:22:34,048
Passing over now.

216
00:22:43,452 --> 00:22:46,125
Steady on course 173.

217
00:22:48,292 --> 00:22:51,728
- How's for lunch?
- Can use.

218
00:22:53,692 --> 00:22:58,322
The captain blew up the power station,
and that silenced the shore batteries.

219
00:22:58,492 --> 00:23:02,121
And then we pumped a dozen fish
into the balance of the convoy...

220
00:23:02,492 --> 00:23:04,130
...and then we beat it.

221
00:23:04,292 --> 00:23:07,409
I guess that was the biggest kick
of the year, eh, captain?

222
00:23:09,932 --> 00:23:11,968
Well, it was a kick, all right.

223
00:23:12,692 --> 00:23:16,128
But I think the biggest kick I got
last year happened on dry land.

224
00:23:16,292 --> 00:23:17,884
Oklahoma City.

225
00:23:18,932 --> 00:23:22,641
I took my little boy to the barbershop
to get his first haircut with me.

226
00:23:22,812 --> 00:23:25,849
I put him up on that little board
they use for children.

227
00:23:26,012 --> 00:23:28,572
I told the barber
to give him a Navy haircut.

228
00:23:28,732 --> 00:23:31,007
I just sat down and watched.

229
00:23:31,372 --> 00:23:34,921
My boy asked if he'd cut it so it
would drop down in front of his eyes.

230
00:23:35,092 --> 00:23:36,810
He'd like to see it fall.

231
00:23:36,972 --> 00:23:40,089
All the men waiting their turns
were grinning at me.

232
00:23:40,812 --> 00:23:44,521
Well, my boy just sat up there,
not saying anything, just looking at me...

233
00:23:44,692 --> 00:23:46,284
...very proud.

234
00:23:46,932 --> 00:23:49,526
Just looking at me with his eyes warm.

235
00:23:50,252 --> 00:23:52,322
It was my turn next.

236
00:23:52,492 --> 00:23:56,644
My little fellow asked the barber, could
he sit on my lap while I got my haircut?

237
00:23:56,852 --> 00:24:00,527
Well, the barber knew the boy and I
don't see very much of each other...

238
00:24:00,692 --> 00:24:02,091
...and he said, "Sure."

239
00:24:02,252 --> 00:24:04,686
So Michael climbed up on my lap.

240
00:24:07,132 --> 00:24:09,600
Oh, I guess it really wasn't much...

241
00:24:10,332 --> 00:24:13,324
...but after a while
he put his head back on my shoulder...

242
00:24:13,652 --> 00:24:17,440
...and looked at all the men
waiting their turns and said:

243
00:24:17,612 --> 00:24:19,568
"This is my daddy."

244
00:24:22,612 --> 00:24:24,523
Just something in the way he said it.

245
00:24:24,692 --> 00:24:27,365
But that was my biggest kick
of last year.

246
00:24:29,412 --> 00:24:33,644
Captain, there's a lad forward, Tommy
Adams, with a high fever, sir, 103.

247
00:24:45,372 --> 00:24:49,650
- Well, what's the matter, son?
- I got a fire in my stomach, sir.

248
00:24:49,812 --> 00:24:53,248
- I'll be all right.
- You don't look too good.

249
00:24:53,412 --> 00:24:56,370
- You sure picked a fine time to get sick.
- I'm sorry, sir.

250
00:24:57,372 --> 00:24:59,328
Take him to my quarters.

251
00:25:07,092 --> 00:25:09,322
What have you done for him?

252
00:25:09,492 --> 00:25:13,804
When a guy gets a bellyache, I usually
give him a pill, but this is different.

253
00:25:13,972 --> 00:25:16,645
With that temperature,
this is more than a bellyache.

254
00:25:16,812 --> 00:25:19,007
That's why I came to you, sir.

255
00:25:19,372 --> 00:25:21,124
What do you think?

256
00:25:21,812 --> 00:25:25,248
If it's what I think it is,
I'm afraid to find out.

257
00:25:25,852 --> 00:25:27,444
Go ahead.

258
00:25:36,812 --> 00:25:38,768
Easy does it. Easy.

259
00:25:39,372 --> 00:25:41,966
What's the matter with me, Pills?

260
00:25:42,132 --> 00:25:45,249
Just relax, kid. You'll be all right.

261
00:25:54,452 --> 00:25:56,602
- Well?
- Listen, captain, I'm not a doctor.

262
00:25:56,772 --> 00:26:00,128
All I know is first aid and handing
out pills. I'm not a doctor.

263
00:26:00,292 --> 00:26:03,090
- All right, you're not a doctor.
- I can't be sure.

264
00:26:03,852 --> 00:26:07,891
I mean, I am sure,
and I don't know what to do about it.

265
00:26:08,052 --> 00:26:09,849
- It's appendicitis, isn't it?
- Yes.

266
00:26:10,012 --> 00:26:13,288
- He has to have an operation right away.
- Can you do it?

267
00:26:13,452 --> 00:26:14,771
- Do what?
- Operate on him.

268
00:26:14,932 --> 00:26:18,447
- I don't know. I never tried.
- I can't help it. Do you know how?

269
00:26:18,612 --> 00:26:20,648
- I've seen a few.
- Remember what you saw?

270
00:26:20,812 --> 00:26:22,530
- Not enough.
- Got a book?

271
00:26:22,692 --> 00:26:25,331
- The Hospital Corps handbook.
- And a book on anatomy?

272
00:26:25,492 --> 00:26:28,404
I can't guarantee anything.
What if I killed him?

273
00:26:28,852 --> 00:26:31,412
What are his chances
if you don't operate?

274
00:26:32,172 --> 00:26:35,403
He hasn't a prayer. He'll die.

275
00:26:36,332 --> 00:26:38,641
Okay, then we operate.

276
00:26:46,612 --> 00:26:49,968
- How do you feel, son?
- Kind of sick.

277
00:26:50,132 --> 00:26:53,204
- I'm sorry, sir, l...
- Don't be.

278
00:26:53,692 --> 00:26:56,206
You know what you've got?
Acute appendicitis.

279
00:26:56,892 --> 00:27:01,363
- Don't worry about me, sir.
- Pills, give it to him straight.

280
00:27:03,252 --> 00:27:05,812
Listen, kid.
I'm just a pharmacist's mate.

281
00:27:06,452 --> 00:27:11,003
I'm all right on vitamins, sun lamps and
pills, but operations are out of my line.

282
00:27:11,732 --> 00:27:14,166
You need an operation, bad.

283
00:27:14,332 --> 00:27:17,802
You'll be dead in a couple of days
if you don't have it right away.

284
00:27:17,972 --> 00:27:19,883
I trust you, Pills.

285
00:27:20,052 --> 00:27:23,283
You know what you're saying?
I can't promise you anything.

286
00:27:23,452 --> 00:27:25,488
Sure, I know.

287
00:27:26,012 --> 00:27:29,322
- When do we get underway?
- You got plenty of what it takes, kid.

288
00:27:30,532 --> 00:27:32,488
You rest easy.

289
00:27:36,972 --> 00:27:39,725
I appreciate all you're doing, sir.

290
00:27:39,892 --> 00:27:42,360
I guess you've got plenty worries
of your own.

291
00:27:42,532 --> 00:27:45,171
We'll do the best we can for you, son.

292
00:27:45,332 --> 00:27:50,690
So I need muscle retractors, scalpels
and clamps.

293
00:27:50,852 --> 00:27:53,969
- Let's see those pictures.
- I can rig a landing light for you.

294
00:27:54,132 --> 00:27:57,044
- That's good.
- These knives are of the finest steel.

295
00:27:57,212 --> 00:28:00,363
If we could just get someone
to grind them down into scalpels.

296
00:28:00,532 --> 00:28:04,366
I'll grind them. Don't worry, Pills.
I can make these things.

297
00:28:04,532 --> 00:28:06,807
Let me take your book with me.

298
00:28:08,772 --> 00:28:11,286
Where do you think you'll do it, Pills?

299
00:28:11,452 --> 00:28:15,047
Why, I guess one of these mess tables
is best.

300
00:28:15,212 --> 00:28:18,363
- All squared away?
- I think so, sir.

301
00:28:18,532 --> 00:28:20,762
You may have to take the angle
off the table.

302
00:28:20,932 --> 00:28:22,365
Yes, sir.

303
00:28:24,372 --> 00:28:27,523
Destroyer passing aft
from port to starboard.

304
00:28:28,532 --> 00:28:30,602
When she's gone,
take her to the bottom.

305
00:28:30,772 --> 00:28:32,728
We're gonna operate
on one of the men.

306
00:28:32,892 --> 00:28:34,450
Aye, aye, sir.

307
00:28:50,452 --> 00:28:52,443
I came as near the pictures as I could.

308
00:28:52,612 --> 00:28:55,080
Didn't waste time
except on the working ends.

309
00:28:55,812 --> 00:28:58,087
Thanks, chief.
Give them to Cookie to boil.

310
00:28:58,252 --> 00:29:00,447
Okay, doc.

311
00:29:09,492 --> 00:29:11,562
- Did you find the ether?
- Yes, sir.

312
00:29:11,732 --> 00:29:13,484
Good. I think I can administer it.

313
00:29:13,652 --> 00:29:16,041
We'd better grease his face
against ether burns.

314
00:29:16,212 --> 00:29:19,727
- Where's the stuff? I'll get it.
- In my kit. The white Vaseline.

315
00:29:19,892 --> 00:29:22,406
Cookie's been working
on the ether cone, sir.

316
00:29:22,572 --> 00:29:26,326
Well, here it is. It's only a tea strainer,
but I hope it'll do the work.

317
00:29:26,492 --> 00:29:28,050
It should.

318
00:29:28,412 --> 00:29:31,529
Tommy, when you come out of this,
you order anything you like.

319
00:29:31,692 --> 00:29:34,081
Start cooking
a pumpkin pie now, Cookie.

320
00:29:34,252 --> 00:29:37,927
Pumpkin pie it is, with spanked cream.

321
00:29:46,732 --> 00:29:50,725
There wasn't a bug I didn't kill.
It's all sterilized, just like a hospital.

322
00:29:50,892 --> 00:29:52,166
Thanks, Cookie.

323
00:29:52,332 --> 00:29:54,766
Go back to your quarters.
I'll keep you informed.

324
00:29:54,932 --> 00:29:57,730
Yes, sir. We'll see you, Tommy.

325
00:29:57,892 --> 00:29:59,211
Course is charted, Pills.

326
00:29:59,692 --> 00:30:01,330
Sounds like dead reckoning, sir.

327
00:30:01,492 --> 00:30:04,131
Can somebody read
if I wanna know something fast?

328
00:30:04,292 --> 00:30:06,283
I'll do it, Pills.

329
00:30:06,452 --> 00:30:08,841
I won't read anything wrong, Tommy.

330
00:30:11,732 --> 00:30:13,927
Don't worry.
Your back's against the wall...

331
00:30:14,092 --> 00:30:17,801
...but you'll come through all right.
You got friends pulling for you.

332
00:30:17,972 --> 00:30:19,690
Thanks, Tin Can.

333
00:30:21,212 --> 00:30:23,407
- Ready for sea, Pills?
- Ready for sea, kid.

334
00:30:24,612 --> 00:30:27,206
I want you to know
that whatever happens, it's okay.

335
00:30:27,572 --> 00:30:29,642
I know you'll do your best.

336
00:30:29,812 --> 00:30:31,530
Thanks, kid.

337
00:30:32,212 --> 00:30:34,248
Everything secure?

338
00:30:34,532 --> 00:30:36,568
Everything secure, sir.

339
00:30:37,372 --> 00:30:39,408
I always say my prayers, sir.

340
00:30:40,692 --> 00:30:42,364
So do I, son.

341
00:30:42,532 --> 00:30:46,127
- Go ahead.
- God bless Mom and Dad.

342
00:30:47,732 --> 00:30:52,601
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

343
00:30:54,252 --> 00:30:57,961
- Breathe deeply, son.
- Thy kingdom come...

344
00:31:23,332 --> 00:31:25,368
How long has it been?

345
00:31:25,812 --> 00:31:27,643
An hour.

346
00:31:28,452 --> 00:31:29,965
Smell that ether?

347
00:31:30,132 --> 00:31:32,885
The pressure in the boat
makes it affect everybody.

348
00:31:37,172 --> 00:31:39,003
Sponge, please.

349
00:31:41,012 --> 00:31:44,209
"After applying the three clamps
to the appendiceal base...

350
00:31:44,372 --> 00:31:48,843
...and before the appendix is divided, the
area is walled off with gauze packs...

351
00:31:49,012 --> 00:31:53,802
...to avoid any possible contamination
or injury to the surrounding structures."

352
00:32:02,612 --> 00:32:05,524
- How long has it been?
- Hour and a half.

353
00:32:11,372 --> 00:32:15,570
"Traction is then made
on the fixed end...

354
00:32:17,012 --> 00:32:21,449
...of the pursestring suture
by pulling it upward."

355
00:32:22,972 --> 00:32:24,724
More sulfa?

356
00:32:27,892 --> 00:32:29,883
He can't pull through.

357
00:32:30,052 --> 00:32:32,930
I'm taking too long.
I did my best, but he can't.

358
00:32:33,212 --> 00:32:36,090
Finish your job. The ether's gone.

359
00:32:47,012 --> 00:32:48,684
Finished.

360
00:33:02,132 --> 00:33:05,204
And lead us not into temptation...

361
00:33:05,372 --> 00:33:08,250
...but deliver us from evil...

362
00:33:08,412 --> 00:33:10,050
...for thine is the kingdom...

363
00:33:11,012 --> 00:33:14,846
...and the power and the glory forever.

364
00:33:17,492 --> 00:33:18,766
Amen.

365
00:33:32,212 --> 00:33:34,646
All right, Wolf, let's get going.

366
00:33:44,572 --> 00:33:46,449
Two carriers.

367
00:33:48,132 --> 00:33:50,123
Four heavy cruisers.

368
00:33:51,292 --> 00:33:52,771
Seven destroyers in the bay.

369
00:33:53,892 --> 00:33:55,371
Over the city.

370
00:33:56,812 --> 00:33:59,531
Barrage balloons
over the Mitsubishi factory.

371
00:34:00,172 --> 00:34:02,288
That's where the Zeros come from.

372
00:34:03,252 --> 00:34:04,685
Over the Nagoya plant...

373
00:34:05,532 --> 00:34:09,081
...there're about 20.

374
00:34:55,332 --> 00:34:58,608
- Nice dogs.
- So well-trained.

375
00:35:25,972 --> 00:35:28,361
- Ready and waiting, sir.
- Enjoy your shore leave?

376
00:35:28,532 --> 00:35:30,124
- Yes, sir.
- Everything okay?

377
00:35:30,292 --> 00:35:32,442
- Yes, sir.
- Here's the Tokyo-Yokohama dope.

378
00:35:32,612 --> 00:35:35,080
We'll surface again at 0330.
Good luck.

379
00:35:48,052 --> 00:35:49,326
Ready to broadcast.

380
00:35:51,452 --> 00:35:54,922
- Give me the time, Sparks.
- Five seconds to go.

381
00:35:55,372 --> 00:35:56,930
Four.

382
00:35:57,172 --> 00:35:58,651
Three.

383
00:35:58,812 --> 00:36:00,165
Two.

384
00:36:02,772 --> 00:36:05,332
<i>Get it, Hornet. Get it sweet and clear.</i>

385
00:36:05,652 --> 00:36:07,210
Three.

386
00:36:07,412 --> 00:36:09,130
Four.

387
00:36:21,172 --> 00:36:24,084
<i>Message from the Copperfin
coming in, sir.</i>

388
00:36:26,372 --> 00:36:27,646
One.

389
00:36:27,812 --> 00:36:29,165
Two.

390
00:36:29,332 --> 00:36:30,606
Three.

391
00:36:30,772 --> 00:36:32,046
Four.

392
00:36:32,212 --> 00:36:33,884
Five.

393
00:36:34,732 --> 00:36:36,882
- Start recording.
- One.

394
00:36:37,052 --> 00:36:39,691
Two. Three.

395
00:36:50,612 --> 00:36:52,523
I'll report to the admiral.

396
00:36:54,012 --> 00:36:56,970
<i>- Copperfin contacted. Report coming in.
- Good.</i>

397
00:36:57,332 --> 00:37:00,608
As soon as the message is complete,
rush the records to decoding.

398
00:37:13,252 --> 00:37:16,881
If the Japs pick it up,
they'll think it's one of their own guys.

399
00:37:17,452 --> 00:37:19,522
Stand by the antenna.

400
00:38:28,412 --> 00:38:31,085
I picked up a motor sound, lieutenant.

401
00:38:31,332 --> 00:38:33,766
Hold the boat. Stand by to shove off.

402
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:16,328
Stand by to pick up shore party.
They're shoving off.

403
00:39:42,092 --> 00:39:45,402
Picking up something
on the promontory, Andy. Check it.

404
00:39:49,092 --> 00:39:52,289
Jap patrol. Lookouts below.
Stand by to dive.

405
00:39:58,172 --> 00:39:59,685
Duck!

406
00:40:08,492 --> 00:40:11,131
Get going. Hurry. Hurry.

407
00:40:19,692 --> 00:40:21,125
Come on. Come on.

408
00:40:23,332 --> 00:40:24,970
Give that gear the deep six.

409
00:40:25,132 --> 00:40:28,010
- Down the hatch, on the double.
- Come on, chief.

410
00:40:32,612 --> 00:40:33,965
Pull the cork!

411
00:40:34,132 --> 00:40:36,930
All ahead full. Level off at 100 feet.

412
00:40:37,092 --> 00:40:38,684
Home sweet home.

413
00:40:38,852 --> 00:40:41,320
<i>Copperfin, sweetheart, I love you.</i>

414
00:41:07,172 --> 00:41:09,970
You won't run into
much interference here.

415
00:41:10,372 --> 00:41:15,287
Those making the Tokyo run will have to
do some plain and fancy hedgehopping.

416
00:41:15,572 --> 00:41:19,281
<i>The weather reports from the Copperfin
are in the hands of the navigators.</i>

417
00:41:19,452 --> 00:41:23,411
The Navy has done a great job
of coordination. The rest is up to us.

418
00:41:23,572 --> 00:41:25,369
Any questions?

419
00:41:26,012 --> 00:41:29,129
One last reminder, fellows.
Double-check your pockets.

420
00:41:29,292 --> 00:41:33,251
Make sure you have nothing on you that
would give information to the enemy.

421
00:41:33,412 --> 00:41:36,882
No man taking off is to have any means
of identification whatsoever.

422
00:41:37,052 --> 00:41:39,725
Who you are, where you're from
or where you're going.

423
00:41:40,132 --> 00:41:43,568
When you get to China, don't get
chop suey. That's an American dish.

424
00:41:43,732 --> 00:41:46,929
Good luck, happy landings,
and God bless you.

425
00:41:47,252 --> 00:41:48,685
<i>Pilots, man your planes!</i>

426
00:41:57,492 --> 00:41:59,881
I'll see that you get them back
personally.

427
00:42:12,732 --> 00:42:14,450
Hey, boy! Go get them, Butch!

428
00:42:15,972 --> 00:42:18,008
So sorry, please.

429
00:42:36,892 --> 00:42:39,645
<i>Attention, officers and men
of the attack force.</i>

430
00:42:39,812 --> 00:42:44,727
<i>Every man on this ship and every man
in the Navy wishes you the best of luck.</i>

431
00:42:46,732 --> 00:42:48,962
Stand by to start engines.

432
00:42:52,092 --> 00:42:54,048
Start engines.

433
00:44:45,492 --> 00:44:47,403
Here come our boys.

434
00:44:47,572 --> 00:44:50,006
I hear Japs are happy to die
for their emperor.

435
00:44:50,172 --> 00:44:53,244
A lot of them are going to be made
very happy.

436
00:45:29,012 --> 00:45:31,890
Take a look at the results
of your broadcast, Ray.

437
00:45:33,412 --> 00:45:37,087
They're dropping eggs all over the place,
men, smack on the target.

438
00:45:37,252 --> 00:45:39,288
Terrific! How do you like that?

439
00:45:39,732 --> 00:45:41,324
Take a look, Andy.

440
00:45:47,892 --> 00:45:49,484
Small ships, bearing 225.

441
00:45:54,532 --> 00:45:58,286
Minesweepers, running interference
for the big babies.

442
00:46:00,892 --> 00:46:03,565
Our planes are chasing
the rats out of their nests.

443
00:46:03,732 --> 00:46:05,848
- Down scope!
- All ahead full.

444
00:46:06,012 --> 00:46:07,889
All ahead full, sir.

445
00:46:08,092 --> 00:46:11,687
They'll lower the gate to let
the capital ships out in a hurry. And us.

446
00:46:21,092 --> 00:46:23,811
We'll take it through the gate
wide-open.

447
00:46:50,572 --> 00:46:54,770
Christoforo Columbo! Here comes
a flattop with a destroyer screen.

448
00:47:00,852 --> 00:47:03,047
Their planes are taking off to tackle ours.

449
00:47:03,212 --> 00:47:05,168
Stand by for a setup.

450
00:47:05,332 --> 00:47:08,210
Mark, bearing 290.

451
00:47:08,852 --> 00:47:10,888
Angle on the bow, 20 degrees starboard.

452
00:47:11,172 --> 00:47:12,969
Range, 6000.

453
00:47:13,132 --> 00:47:16,204
Estimated speed, 20 knots. Down scope.

454
00:47:17,652 --> 00:47:21,247
Steady on course 085.
All ahead full.

455
00:47:21,772 --> 00:47:25,162
- Make all tubes ready for firing.
- Make all tubes ready for firing.

456
00:47:27,092 --> 00:47:31,210
<i>Torpedo setting, 12 feet, high speed.
Firing order, one, three, four, two.</i>

457
00:47:31,372 --> 00:47:33,488
Firing bearing 338.

458
00:47:40,252 --> 00:47:41,571
Fire one.

459
00:47:42,692 --> 00:47:44,603
- Give me a time check.
- Four seconds.

460
00:47:44,772 --> 00:47:46,251
- Five seconds.
- Fire three.

461
00:47:50,372 --> 00:47:51,885
Fire four.

462
00:47:55,292 --> 00:47:57,010
Fire two.

463
00:47:59,012 --> 00:48:00,491
Down scope.

464
00:48:00,652 --> 00:48:03,086
Twenty-one seconds, 22 seconds,
23 seconds.

465
00:48:13,932 --> 00:48:15,365
Missed him with number one.

466
00:48:21,532 --> 00:48:23,204
- That was mine!
- It was mine!

467
00:48:23,372 --> 00:48:24,646
Number one!

468
00:48:30,412 --> 00:48:34,451
Take her under the carrier. We'll finish
the job with the sting from our tail.

469
00:49:24,212 --> 00:49:26,043
Stand by stern tubes.

470
00:49:27,652 --> 00:49:29,005
Fire five.

471
00:49:29,572 --> 00:49:31,164
Fire six.

472
00:49:34,612 --> 00:49:35,965
Fire eight.

473
00:49:37,892 --> 00:49:39,484
Fire seven.

474
00:50:13,652 --> 00:50:16,007
Take her down. Rig for depth charge.

475
00:50:17,972 --> 00:50:19,371
Take the angle off the boat.

476
00:50:19,532 --> 00:50:22,285
Zero dive bubbles.
Level off at 150 feet.

477
00:50:43,052 --> 00:50:44,690
Hang on, it's gonna get rougher.

478
00:50:45,652 --> 00:50:48,530
- All rigged for depth charges, kid?
- Yes, sir.

479
00:50:48,692 --> 00:50:52,446
When you hear the metallic
click-click, hang on.

480
00:50:57,692 --> 00:51:00,809
- See what I mean?
- Sure giving them a licking, aren't we?

481
00:51:02,612 --> 00:51:03,886
Yeah.

482
00:51:18,492 --> 00:51:20,801
You'll pay off for this too,
you dirty snipes.

483
00:51:20,972 --> 00:51:23,361
Nita, I think they found out
where we are.

484
00:51:33,652 --> 00:51:35,882
Switch to emergency lighting.

485
00:51:45,092 --> 00:51:46,366
I bet $5 the next one...

486
00:51:46,532 --> 00:51:48,921
...drops on the starboard side.
- I'll take it.

487
00:51:58,492 --> 00:52:03,566
Hey, fellas, the next war,
I'm going to the Ozarks and hide.

488
00:52:08,052 --> 00:52:09,883
Oh, Duke.

489
00:52:11,852 --> 00:52:13,649
- I'm sorry.
- Skip it, Cookie.

490
00:52:13,812 --> 00:52:16,849
I'd rather get wet that way than
have Jap seawater on me.

491
00:52:28,172 --> 00:52:30,640
All stop. We'll try
and coast out from under them.

492
00:52:34,292 --> 00:52:36,203
- Congratulations, Wolf.
- On what?

493
00:52:36,372 --> 00:52:38,761
It's an hour since you were
reminded of a dame.

494
00:52:43,252 --> 00:52:45,004
Sorry, honey.

495
00:52:45,972 --> 00:52:47,849
The exec told me to rope you in.

496
00:52:48,012 --> 00:52:50,572
What makes the clicks
before the depth charges?

497
00:52:50,892 --> 00:52:54,805
Well, we figure it's the detonator
going off before the main charge.

498
00:52:55,252 --> 00:52:58,881
Here's a pencil. Skipper won't mind
if you keep score on his bulkhead.

499
00:53:02,932 --> 00:53:06,049
- All ahead full.
- Shoot me a toolbox!

500
00:53:13,612 --> 00:53:15,648
All secured, sir.

501
00:53:17,252 --> 00:53:20,961
Hello, Ray. Want something to lean on?
There's plenty more coming.

502
00:53:22,452 --> 00:53:26,047
Well, anyway, Tokyo got its face lifted.

503
00:53:26,212 --> 00:53:28,851
And we got ourselves a flattop.

504
00:53:29,012 --> 00:53:30,684
Captain.

505
00:53:31,332 --> 00:53:33,288
- I'm no good.
- Why not?

506
00:53:33,612 --> 00:53:36,604
- I'm scared stiff.
- How do you think the rest of us feel?

507
00:53:37,572 --> 00:53:39,608
You're not scared.

508
00:53:40,052 --> 00:53:42,612
- I've looked at your faces.
- I looked at yours too.

509
00:53:42,932 --> 00:53:45,321
- It's the same as the others.
- You're scared?

510
00:53:45,692 --> 00:53:47,887
I'll say I am.

511
00:53:48,212 --> 00:53:50,442
So is everyone else.

512
00:54:12,652 --> 00:54:14,244
What's the matter? You scared?

513
00:54:14,612 --> 00:54:17,604
No. I was just checking
my grocery stores.

514
00:54:24,612 --> 00:54:29,242
Would any of you fellas be interested
in a 1938 motor scooter?

515
00:54:31,892 --> 00:54:34,770
It's no good, chief.
We're taking a lot of water, sir.

516
00:54:34,932 --> 00:54:38,322
We get one leak wedged,
and another one starts.

517
00:54:45,652 --> 00:54:48,212
- Captain to the phone.
- Phone, captain.

518
00:54:53,932 --> 00:54:56,207
- Yeah?
- Bad leaks in the after-room, skipper.

519
00:54:56,372 --> 00:55:00,285
- Haven't been able to stop them.
- Well, maybe we've lost the Nips.

520
00:55:00,452 --> 00:55:02,886
I'll take a chance on the pumps.

521
00:55:05,612 --> 00:55:08,365
Start drain pumps
on the after-bilges and stand by.

522
00:55:21,492 --> 00:55:24,529
Salt tablets to make up
for what you sweated out.

523
00:55:25,852 --> 00:55:27,604
Thanks.

524
00:55:30,132 --> 00:55:32,487
Do you guys want cotton
for your ears?

525
00:55:32,652 --> 00:55:35,564
If it gets that close,
you won't need cotton.

526
00:55:44,372 --> 00:55:47,205
Pills, do you think prayers do
any good?

527
00:55:48,852 --> 00:55:50,763
Yes, they do.

528
00:55:50,932 --> 00:55:52,206
I know they do.

529
00:56:00,892 --> 00:56:02,371
Secure the pump!

530
00:56:11,092 --> 00:56:12,844
Give me another wedge!

531
00:56:13,012 --> 00:56:15,207
Captain on the phone, sir.

532
00:56:17,412 --> 00:56:20,051
You'll have to plug the leaks
as best you can, Andy.

533
00:56:20,212 --> 00:56:23,887
- Those Japs are too smart for us.
- We'll do our best.

534
00:56:39,892 --> 00:56:41,484
Back home, we'd call this fun.

535
00:56:44,372 --> 00:56:48,570
If they don't stop those leaks aft, we'll
be headed for the bottom, stern first.

536
00:56:59,892 --> 00:57:01,644
That's a pretty pattern, that one.

537
00:57:03,052 --> 00:57:05,691
I wonder how the invasion
of Europe is getting along.

538
00:57:39,172 --> 00:57:41,732
Water getting higher
in the after-room, sir.

539
00:57:43,572 --> 00:57:47,121
Come on! Fill them up!
Those are not finger bowls!

540
00:58:11,732 --> 00:58:14,246
We can't take any more
of this. We're finished!

541
00:58:14,412 --> 00:58:16,403
Shut up, Dakota. Don't yell.

542
00:58:17,732 --> 00:58:21,281
Skipper's got to get us out of this.
I've got to see the skipper!

543
00:58:21,452 --> 00:58:22,965
Let go!

544
00:58:26,532 --> 00:58:29,808
I'm sorry I had to sock you.
It was either your chin or the boat.

545
00:58:29,972 --> 00:58:31,610
There's nothing else we could do.

546
00:58:31,772 --> 00:58:34,332
We gotta take it.
We can't win if we can't take it.

547
00:58:34,492 --> 00:58:36,084
Don't you know that?

548
00:58:39,652 --> 00:58:42,769
This ship's taken more
than she should have to.

549
00:58:43,892 --> 00:58:46,167
Anybody hurt back there?

550
00:58:46,452 --> 00:58:48,249
Several.

551
00:58:48,532 --> 00:58:50,488
Pills is fixing them up.

552
00:58:52,692 --> 00:58:55,001
The batteries are low.

553
00:58:57,132 --> 00:58:58,690
If we don't surface soon...

554
00:59:15,332 --> 00:59:18,802
Well, I think we're all tired
of getting pushed around.

555
00:59:19,092 --> 00:59:21,481
How many destroyers
do you count, soundman?

556
00:59:21,652 --> 00:59:23,802
Only one for the moment, sir.

557
00:59:25,372 --> 00:59:28,045
Let's take a crack at that Jap.
All ahead full.

558
00:59:29,532 --> 00:59:31,966
- Ready on the bow tubes.
- Ready on the bow tubes.

559
00:59:32,132 --> 00:59:35,090
- Bring her up smartly.
- Switch to power operation.

560
00:59:35,252 --> 00:59:36,844
Full rise on the bow planes.

561
00:59:37,012 --> 00:59:38,365
Close vents.

562
00:59:38,532 --> 00:59:40,409
- Destroyer bearing.
- Zero-one-five.

563
00:59:40,572 --> 00:59:42,528
Vents closed, sir.

564
00:59:49,332 --> 00:59:52,688
- Stand by the bow tubes.
- Standing by forward, sir.

565
00:59:56,452 --> 00:59:59,171
He's spotted us. Here he comes.

566
00:59:59,732 --> 01:00:01,723
We'll only get one chance at him.

567
01:00:01,892 --> 01:00:03,166
Make it good.

568
01:00:05,812 --> 01:00:07,086
Stand by to fire.

569
01:00:08,052 --> 01:00:09,883
Stand by.

570
01:00:10,612 --> 01:00:12,523
Stand by.

571
01:00:13,172 --> 01:00:15,049
Stand by.

572
01:00:15,252 --> 01:00:17,083
Fire one!

573
01:00:17,252 --> 01:00:18,890
Fire two!

574
01:00:25,772 --> 01:00:27,410
We got him!

575
01:00:27,572 --> 01:00:31,042
- We got him!
- Sweetheart, I love you!

576
01:00:31,212 --> 01:00:33,487
- Yeah, we got him!
- Oh, brother.

577
01:00:41,972 --> 01:00:43,530
There he goes...

578
01:00:43,692 --> 01:00:45,728
...down for the deep six.

579
01:00:50,532 --> 01:00:52,204
Let's get out of here.

580
01:01:16,852 --> 01:01:18,604
Look, chief.

581
01:01:18,772 --> 01:01:21,570
I wonder if they're going
where we've been.

582
01:01:23,732 --> 01:01:25,802
Could be.

583
01:01:29,132 --> 01:01:32,727
Hey, Eddie, do you think that sub
down there saw any action?

584
01:01:33,212 --> 01:01:36,761
No, probably just out
for a couple of practice dives.

585
01:01:40,772 --> 01:01:43,081
I'm hopping the first train
back to the farm...

586
01:01:43,252 --> 01:01:47,291
...and I'm busting open
a big barrel of cider just for me.

587
01:01:47,452 --> 01:01:51,923
I'm going to a platter shop, and I'm
gonna get drunk on Dinah Shore records.

588
01:01:52,212 --> 01:01:55,727
Every night for weeks,
I've been dreaming of green vegetables.

589
01:01:56,052 --> 01:01:57,929
Four heads of lettuce, all in a row.

590
01:01:58,092 --> 01:02:00,686
Boy, I'm dreaming of something else.

591
01:02:03,172 --> 01:02:06,926
Well, there'll be somebody hanging
over a hot stove for me for a change.

592
01:02:09,092 --> 01:02:11,811
Me, I'm gonna take my girl out
in a canoe and propose.

593
01:02:11,972 --> 01:02:14,645
Gonna get married and have seven kids.

594
01:02:15,572 --> 01:02:18,325
You wait till I'm a doctor,
I'll deliver them for free.

595
01:02:18,492 --> 01:02:20,926
That reminds me, I want
a picture of that scar...

596
01:02:21,092 --> 01:02:24,323
...to put on the wall of my office
when the war's over.

597
01:02:24,532 --> 01:02:28,684
It's like Mike said. When you're here,
you wish you were back out there.

598
01:02:29,812 --> 01:02:32,770
Won't be such a long time
between beers now, captain.

599
01:02:42,492 --> 01:02:45,689
For a moment, I thought I saw
my wife and kids on that dock.

600
01:02:45,852 --> 01:02:47,888
I couldn't be that lucky.

601
01:02:48,172 --> 01:02:51,448
Maybe wives have a way of knowing
when their men are coming home.

602
01:02:51,612 --> 01:02:53,284
Take another look.

603
01:03:05,652 --> 01:03:07,131
You're right.

604
01:03:08,372 --> 01:03:10,363
I couldn't be that lucky.

605
01:03:10,532 --> 01:03:12,124
But I am.

606
01:03:14,132 --> 01:03:19,286
<i>To the United States Navy, our thanks
for making this picture possible.</i>

607
01:03:19,452 --> 01:03:22,967
<i>To the gallant officers and men
of the silent service...</i>

608
01:03:23,132 --> 01:03:27,410
<i>... to our submarines,
now on war patrol in hostile waters...</i>

609
01:03:27,572 --> 01:03:32,009
<i>... good luck and good hunting.</i>
